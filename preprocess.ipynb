To be content with what we at present know, is, for the\\nmost part, to shut our ears against conviction; since, from the very\\ngradual character of our education, we must continually forget, and\\nemancipate ourselves from, knowledge previously acquired; we must set\\naside old notions and embrace fresh ones; and, as we learn, we must be\\ndaily unlearning something which it has cost us no small labour and\\nanxiety to acquire.\\n\\nAnd this difficulty attaches itself more closely to an age in which\\nprogress has gained a strong ascendency over prejudice, and in which\\npersons and things are, day by day, finding their real level, in lieu\\nof their conventional value. The same principles which have swept away\\ntraditional abuses, and which are making rapid havoc among the revenues\\nof sinecurists, and stripping the thin, tawdry veil from attractive\\nsuperstitions, are working as actively in literature as in society. The\\ncredulity of one writer, or the partiality of another, finds as\\npowerful a touchstone and as wholesome a chastisement in the healthy\\nscepticism of a temperate class of antagonists, as the dreams of\\nconservatism, or the impostures of pluralist sinecures in the Church.\\nHistory and tradition, whether of ancient or comparatively recent\\ntimes, are subjected to very different handling from that which the\\nindulgence or credulity of former ages could allow. Mere statements are\\njealously watched, and the motives of the writer form as important an\\ningredient in the analysis of his history, as the facts he records.\\nProbability is a powerful and troublesome test; and it is by this\\ntroublesome standard that a large portion of historical evidence is\\nsifted. Consistency is no less pertinacious and exacting in its\\ndemands. In brief, to write a history, we must know more than mere\\nfacts. Human nature, viewed under an induction of extended experience,\\nis the best help to the criticism of human history. Historical\\ncharacters can only be estimated by the standard which human\\nexperience, whether actual or traditionary, has furnished. To form\\ncorrect views of individuals we must regard them as forming parts of a\\ngreat whole—we must measure them by their relation to the mass of\\nbeings by whom they are surrounded, and, in contemplating the incidents\\nin their lives or condition which tradition has handed down to us, we\\nmust rather consider the general bearing of the whole narrative, than\\nthe respective probability of its details.\\n\\nIt is unfortunate for us, that, of some of the greatest men, we know\\nleast, and talk most. Homer, Socrates, and Shakespere[1] have, perhaps,\\ncontributed more to the intellectual enlightenment of mankind than any\\nother three writers who could be named, and yet the history of all\\nthree has given rise to a boundless ocean of discussion, which has left\\nus little save the option of choosing which theory or theories we will\\nfollow. The personality of Shakespere is, perhaps, the only thing in\\nwhich critics will allow us to believe without controversy; but upon\\neverything else, even down to the authorship of plays, there is more or\\nless of doubt and uncertainty. Of Socrates we know as little as the\\ncontradictions of Plato and Xenophon will allow us to know. He was one\\nof the _dramatis personæ_ in two dramas as unlike in principles as in\\nstyle. He appears as the enunciator of opinions as different in their\\ntone as those of the writers who have handed them down. When we have\\nread Plato _or_ Xenophon, we think we know something of Socrates; when\\nwe have fairly read and examined both, we feel convinced that we are\\nsomething worse than ignorant.\\n\\nIt has been an easy, and a popular expedient, of late years, to deny\\nthe personal or real existence of men and things whose life and\\ncondition were too much for our belief. This system—which has often\\ncomforted the religious sceptic, and substituted the consolations of\\nStrauss for those of the New Testament—has been of incalculable value\\nto the historical theorists of the last and present centuries. To\\nquestion the existence of Alexander the Great, would be a more\\nexcusable act, than to believe in that of Romulus. To deny a fact\\nrelated in Herodotus, because it is inconsistent with a theory\\ndeveloped from an Assyrian inscription which no two scholars read in\\nthe same way, is more pardonable, than to believe in the good-natured\\nold king whom the elegant pen of Florian has idealized—_Numa\\nPompilius._\\n\\nScepticism has attained its culminating point with respect to Homer,\\nand the state of our Homeric knowledge may be described as a free\\npermission to believe any theory, provided we throw overboard all\\nwritten tradition, concerning the author or authors of the Iliad and\\nOdyssey. What few authorities exist on the subject, are summarily\\ndismissed, although the arguments appear to run in a circle. “This\\ncannot be true, because it is not true; and, that is not true, because\\nit cannot be true.” Such seems to be the style, in which testimony upon\\ntestimony, statement upon statement, is consigned to denial and\\noblivion.\\n\\nIt is, however, unfortunate that the professed biographies of Homer are\\npartly forgeries, partly freaks of ingenuity and imagination, in which\\ntruth is the requisite most wanting. Before taking a brief review of\\nthe Homeric theory in its present conditions, some notice must be taken\\nof the treatise on the Life of Homer which has been attributed to\\nHerodotus.\\n\\nAccording to this document, the city of Cumæ in Æolia, was, at an\\nearly period, the seat of frequent immigrations from various parts of\\nGreece. Among the immigrants was Menapolus, the son of Ithagenes.\\nAlthough poor, he married, and the result of the union was a girl named\\nCritheïs. The girl was left an orphan at an early age, under the\\nguardianship of Cleanax, of Argos. It is to the indiscretion of this\\nmaiden that we “are indebted for so much happiness.” Homer was the\\nfirst fruit of her juvenile frailty, and received the name of\\nMelesigenes, from having been born near the river Meles, in Bœotia,\\nwhither Critheïs had been transported in order to save her reputation.\\n\\n“At this time,” continues our narrative, “there lived at Smyrna a man\\nnamed Phemius, a teacher of literature and music, who, not being\\nmarried, engaged Critheïs to manage his household, and spin the flax he\\nreceived as the price of his scholastic labours. So satisfactory was\\nher performance of this task, and so modest her conduct, that he made\\nproposals of marriage, declaring himself, as a further inducement,\\nwilling to adopt her son, who, he asserted, would become a clever man,\\nif he were carefully brought up.”\\n\\nThey were married; careful cultivation ripened the talents which nature\\nhad bestowed, and Melesigenes soon surpassed his schoolfellows in every\\nattainment, and, when older, rivalled his preceptor in wisdom. Phemius\\ndied, leaving him sole heir to his property, and his mother soon\\nfollowed. Melesigenes carried on his adopted father’s school with great\\nsuccess, exciting the admiration not only of the inhabitants of Smyrna,\\nbut also of the strangers whom the trade carried on there, especially\\nin the exportation of corn, attracted to that city. Among these\\nvisitors, one Mentes, from Leucadia, the modern Santa Maura, who\\nevinced a knowledge and intelligence rarely found in those times,\\npersuaded Melesigenes to close his school, and accompany him on his\\ntravels. He promised not only to pay his expenses, but to furnish him\\nwith a further stipend, urging, that, “While he was yet young, it was\\nfitting that he should see with his own eyes the countries and cities\\nwhich might hereafter be the subjects of his discourses.” Melesigenes\\nconsented, and set out with his patron, “examining all the curiosities\\nof the countries they visited, and informing himself of everything by\\ninterrogating those whom he met.” We may also suppose, that he wrote\\nmemoirs of all that he deemed worthy of preservation.[2] Having set\\nsail from Tyrrhenia and Iberia, they reached Ithaca. Here Melesigenes,\\nwho had already suffered in his eyes, became much worse, and Mentes,\\nwho was about to leave for Leucadia, left him to the medical\\nsuperintendence of a friend of his, named Mentor, the son of Alcinor.\\nUnder his hospitable and intelligent host, Melesigenes rapidly became\\nacquainted with the legends respecting Ulysses, which afterwards formed\\nthe subject of the Odyssey. The inhabitants of Ithaca assert, that it\\nwas here that Melesigenes became blind, but the Colophomans make their\\ncity the seat of that misfortune. He then returned to Smyrna, where he\\napplied himself to the study of poetry.[3]\\n\\nBut poverty soon drove him to Cumæ. Having passed over the Hermæan\\nplain, he arrived at Neon Teichos, the New Wall, a colony of Cumæ.\\nHere his misfortunes and poetical talent gained him the friendship of\\none Tychias, an armourer. “And up to my time,” continued the author,\\n“the inhabitants showed the place where he used to sit when giving a\\nrecitation of his verses, and they greatly honoured the spot. Here also\\na poplar grew, which they said had sprung up ever since Melesigenes\\narrived”.[4]\\n\\nBut poverty still drove him on, and he went by way of Larissa, as being\\nthe most convenient road. Here, the Cumans say, he composed an epitaph\\non Gordius, king of Phrygia, which has however, and with greater\\nprobability, been attributed to Cleobulus of Lindus.[5]\\n\\nArrived at Cumæ, he frequented the _converzationes_[6] of the old men,\\nand delighted all by the charms of his poetry. Encouraged by this\\nfavourable reception, he declared that, if they would allow him a\\npublic maintenance, he would render their city most gloriously\\nrenowned. They avowed their willingness to support him in the measure\\nhe proposed, and procured him an audience in the council. Having made\\nthe speech, with the purport of which our author has forgotten to\\nacquaint us, he retired, and left them to debate respecting the answer\\nto be given to his proposal.\\n\\nThe greater part of the assembly seemed favourable to the poet’s\\ndemand, but one man observed that “if they were to feed _Homers_, they\\nwould be encumbered with a multitude of useless people.” “From this\\ncircumstance,” says the writer, “Melesigenes acquired the name of\\nHomer, for the Cumans call blind men _Homers_.”[7] With a love of\\neconomy, which shows how similar the world has always been in its\\ntreatment of literary men, the pension was denied, and the poet vented\\nhis disappointment in a wish that Cumæa might never produce a poet\\ncapable of giving it renown and glory.\\n\\nAt Phocœa, Homer was destined to experience another literary distress.\\nOne Thestorides, who aimed at the reputation of poetical genius, kept\\nHomer in his own house, and allowed him a pittance, on condition of the\\nverses of the poet passing in his name. Having collected sufficient\\npoetry to be profitable, Thestorides, like some would-be-literary\\npublishers, neglected the man whose brains he had sucked, and left him.\\nAt his departure, Homer is said to have observed: “O Thestorides, of\\nthe many things hidden from the knowledge of man, nothing is more\\nunintelligible than the human heart.”[8]\\n\\nHomer continued his career of difficulty and distress, until some Chian\\nmerchants, struck by the similarity of the verses they heard him\\nrecite, acquainted him with the fact that Thestorides was pursuing a\\nprofitable livelihood by the recital of the very same poems. This at\\nonce determined him to set out for Chios. No vessel happened then to be\\nsetting sail thither, but he found one ready to start for Erythræ, a\\ntown of Ionia, which faces that island, and he prevailed upon the\\nseamen to allow him to accompany them. Having embarked, he invoked a\\nfavourable wind, and prayed that he might be able to expose the\\nimposture of Thestorides, who, by his breach of hospitality, had drawn\\ndown the wrath of Jove the Hospitable.\\n\\nAt Erythræ, Homer fortunately met with a person who had known him in\\nPhocœa, by whose assistance he at length, after some difficulty,\\nreached the little hamlet of Pithys. Here he met with an adventure,\\nwhich we will continue in the words of our author. “Having set out from\\nPithys, Homer went on, attracted by the cries of some goats that were\\npasturing. The dogs barked on his approach, and he cried out. Glaucus\\n(for that was the name of the goat-herd) heard his voice, ran up\\nquickly, called off his dogs, and drove them away from Homer. For some\\ntime he stood wondering how a blind man should have reached such a\\nplace alone, and what could be his design in coming. He then went up to\\nhim, and inquired who he was, and how he had come to desolate places\\nand untrodden spots, and of what he stood in need. Homer, by recounting\\nto him the whole history of his misfortunes, moved him with compassion;\\nand he took him, and led him to his cot, and having lit a fire, bade\\nhim sup.[9]\\n\\n“The dogs, instead of eating, kept barking at the stranger, according\\nto their usual habit. Whereupon Homer addressed Glaucus thus: O\\nGlaucus, my friend, prythee attend to my behest. First give the dogs\\ntheir supper at the doors of the hut: for so it is better, since,\\nwhilst they watch, nor thief nor wild beast will approach the fold.\\n\\nGlaucus was pleased with the advice, and marvelled at its author.\\nHaving finished supper, they banqueted[10] afresh on conversation,\\nHomer narrating his wanderings, and telling of the cities he had\\nvisited.\\n\\nAt length they retired to rest; but on the following morning, Glaucus\\nresolved to go to his master, and acquaint him with his meeting with\\nHomer. Having left the goats in charge of a fellow-servant, he left\\nHomer at home, promising to return quickly. Having arrived at Bolissus,\\na place near the farm, and finding his mate, he told him the whole\\nstory respecting Homer and his journey. He paid little attention to\\nwhat he said, and blamed Glaucus for his stupidity in taking in and\\nfeeding maimed and enfeebled persons. However, he bade him bring the\\nstranger to him.\\n\\nGlaucus told Homer what had taken place, and bade him follow him,\\nassuring him that good fortune would be the result. Conversation soon\\nshowed that the stranger was a man of much cleverness and general\\nknowledge, and the Chian persuaded him to remain, and to undertake the\\ncharge of his children.[11]\\n\\nBesides the satisfaction of driving the impostor Thestorides from the\\nisland, Homer enjoyed considerable success as a teacher. In the town of\\nChios he established a school where he taught the precepts of poetry.\\n“To this day,” says Chandler,[12] “the most curious remaining is that\\nwhich has been named, without reason, the School of Homer. It is on the\\ncoast, at some distance from the city, northward, and appears to have\\nbeen an open temple of Cybele, formed on the top of a rock. The shape\\nis oval, and in the centre is the image of the goddess, the head and an\\narm wanting. She is represented, as usual, sitting. The chair has a\\nlion carved on each side, and on the back. The area is bounded by a low\\nrim, or seat, and about five yards over. The whole is hewn out of the\\nmountain, is rude, indistinct, and probably of the most remote\\nantiquity.”\\n\\nSo successful was this school, that Homer realised a considerable\\nfortune. He married, and had two daughters, one of whom died single,\\nthe other married a Chian.\\n\\nThe following passage betrays the same tendency to connect the\\npersonages of the poems with the history of the poet, which has already\\nbeen mentioned:—\\n\\n“In his poetical compositions Homer displays great gratitude towards\\nMentor of Ithaca, in the Odyssey, whose name he has inserted in his\\npoem as the companion of Ulysses,[13] in return for the care taken of\\nhim when afflicted with blindness. He also testifies his gratitude to\\nPhemius, who had given him both sustenance and instruction.”\\n\\nHis celebrity continued to increase, and many persons advised him to\\nvisit Greece, whither his reputation had now extended. Having, it is\\nsaid, made some additions to his poems calculated to please the vanity\\nof the Athenians, of whose city he had hitherto made no mention,[14] he\\nsent out for Samos. Here being recognized by a Samian, who had met with\\nhim in Chios, he was handsomely received, and invited to join in\\ncelebrating the Apaturian festival. He recited some verses, which gave\\ngreat satisfaction, and by singing the Eiresione at the New Moon\\nfestivals, he earned a subsistence, visiting the houses of the rich,\\nwith whose children he was very popular.\\n\\nIn the spring he sailed for Athens, and arrived at the island of Ios,\\nnow Ino, where he fell extremely ill, and died. It is said that his\\ndeath arose from vexation, at not having been able to unravel an enigma\\nproposed by some fishermen’s children.[15]\\n\\nSuch is, in brief, the substance of the earliest life of Homer we\\npossess, and so broad are the evidences of its historical\\nworthlessness, that it is scarcely necessary to point them out in\\ndetail. Let us now consider some of the opinions to which a\\npersevering, patient, and learned—but by no means consistent—series of\\ninvestigations has led. In doing so, I profess to bring forward\\nstatements, not to vouch for their reasonableness or probability.\\n\\n“Homer appeared. The history of this poet and his works is lost in\\ndoubtful obscurity, as is the history of many of the first minds who\\nhave done honour to humanity, because they rose amidst darkness. The\\nmajestic stream of his song, blessing and fertilizing, flows like the\\nNile, through many lands and nations; and, like the sources of the\\nNile, its fountains will ever remain concealed.”\\n\\nSuch are the words in which one of the most judicious German critics\\nhas eloquently described the uncertainty in which the whole of the\\nHomeric question is involved. With no less truth and feeling he\\nproceeds:—\\n\\n“It seems here of chief importance to expect no more than the nature of\\nthings makes possible. If the period of tradition in history is the\\nregion of twilight, we should not expect in it perfect light. The\\ncreations of genius always seem like miracles, because they are, for\\nthe most part, created far out of the reach of observation. If we were\\nin possession of all the historical testimonies, we never could wholly\\nexplain the origin of the Iliad and the Odyssey; for their origin, in\\nall essential points, must have remained the secret of the poet.”[16]\\n\\nFrom this criticism, which shows as much insight into the depths of\\nhuman nature as into the minute wire-drawings of scholastic\\ninvestigation, let us pass on to the main question at issue. Was Homer\\nan individual?[17] or were the Iliad and Odyssey the result of an\\ningenious arrangement of fragments by earlier poets?\\n\\nWell has Landor remarked: “Some tell us there were twenty Homers; some\\ndeny that there was ever one. It were idle and foolish to shake the\\ncontents of a vase, in order to let them settle at last. We are\\nperpetually labouring to destroy our delights, our composure, our\\ndevotion to superior power. Of all the animals on earth we least know\\nwhat is good for us. My opinion is, that what is best for us is our\\nadmiration of good. No man living venerates Homer more than I do.”[18]\\n\\nBut, greatly as we admire the generous enthusiasm which rests contented\\nwith the poetry on which its best impulses had been nurtured and\\nfostered, without seeking to destroy the vividness of first impressions\\nby minute analysis—our editorial office compels us to give some\\nattention to the doubts and difficulties with which the Homeric\\nquestion is beset, and to entreat our reader, for a brief period, to\\nprefer his judgment to his imagination, and to condescend to dry\\ndetails.\\n\\nBefore, however, entering into particulars respecting the question of\\nthis unity of the Homeric poems, (at least of the Iliad,) I must\\nexpress my sympathy with the sentiments expressed in the following\\nremarks:—\\n\\n“We cannot but think the universal admiration of its unity by the\\nbetter, the poetic age of Greece, almost conclusive testimony to its\\noriginal composition. It was not till the age of the grammarians that\\nits primitive integrity was called in question; nor is it injustice to\\nassert, that the minute and analytical spirit of a grammarian is not\\nthe best qualification for the profound feeling, the comprehensive\\nconception of an harmonious whole. The most exquisite anatomist may be\\nno judge of the symmetry of the human frame: and we would take the\\nopinion of Chantrey or Westmacott on the proportions and general beauty\\nof a form, rather than that of Mr. Brodie or Sir Astley Cooper.\\n\\n“There is some truth, though some malicious exaggeration, in the lines\\nof Pope.—\\n\\n“‘The critic eye—that microscope of wit\\nSees hairs and pores, examines bit by bit,\\nHow parts relate to parts, or they to whole,\\nThe body’s harmony, the beaming soul,\\nAre things which Kuster, Burmann, Wasse, shall see,\\nWhen man’s whole frame is obvious to a flea.’”[19]\\n\\n\\nLong was the time which elapsed before any one dreamt of questioning\\nthe unity of the authorship of the Homeric poems. The grave and\\ncautious Thucydides quoted without hesitation the Hymn to Apollo,[20]\\nthe authenticity of which has been already disclaimed by modern\\ncritics. Longinus, in an oft quoted passage, merely expressed an\\nopinion touching the comparative inferiority of the Odyssey to the\\nIliad,[21] and, among a mass of ancient authors, whose very names[22]\\nit would be tedious to detail, no suspicion of the personal\\nnon-existence of Homer ever arose. So far, the voice of antiquity seems\\nto be in favour of our early ideas on the subject; let us now see what\\nare the discoveries to which more modern investigations lay claim.\\n\\nAt the end of the seventeenth century, doubts had begun to awaken on\\nthe subject, and we find Bentley remarking that “Homer wrote a sequel\\nof songs and rhapsodies, to be sung by himself, for small comings and\\ngood cheer, at festivals and other days of merriment. These loose songs\\nwere not collected together, in the form of an epic poem, till about\\nPeisistratus’ time, about five hundred years after.”[23]\\n\\nTwo French writers—Hedelin and Perrault—avowed a similar scepticism on\\nthe subject; but it is in the “Scienza Nuova” of Battista Vico, that we\\nfirst meet with the germ of the theory, subsequently defended by Wolf\\nwith so much learning and acuteness. Indeed, it is with the Wolfian\\ntheory that we have chiefly to deal, and with the following bold\\nhypothesis, which we will detail in the words of Grote:—[24]\\n\\n“Half a century ago, the acute and valuable Prolegomena of F. A. Wolf,\\nturning to account the Venetian Scholia, which had then been recently\\npublished, first opened philosophical discussion as to the history of\\nthe Homeric text. A considerable part of that dissertation (though by\\nno means the whole) is employed in vindicating the position, previously\\nannounced by Bentley, amongst others, that the separate constituent\\nportions of the Iliad and Odyssey had not been cemented together into\\nany compact body and unchangeable order, until the days of\\nPeisistratus, in the sixth century before Christ. As a step towards\\nthat conclusion, Wolf maintained that no written copies of either poem\\ncould be shown to have existed during the earlier times, to which their\\ncomposition is referred; and that without writing, neither the perfect\\nsymmetry of so complicated a work could have been originally conceived\\nby any poet, nor, if realized by him, transmitted with assurance to\\nposterity. The absence of easy and convenient writing, such as must be\\nindispensably supposed for long manuscripts, among the early Greeks,\\nwas thus one of the points in Wolf’s case against the primitive\\nintegrity of the Iliad and Odyssey. By Nitzsch, and other leading\\nopponents of Wolf, the connection of the one with the other seems to\\nhave been accepted as he originally put it; and it has been considered\\nincumbent on those who defended the ancient aggregate character of the\\nIliad and Odyssey, to maintain that they were written poems from the\\nbeginning.\\n\\n“To me it appears, that the architectonic functions ascribed by Wolf to\\nPeisistratus and his associates, in reference to the Homeric poems, are\\nnowise admissible. But much would undoubtedly be gained towards that\\nview of the question, if it could be shown, that, in order to\\ncontrovert it, we were driven to the necessity of admitting long\\nwritten poems, in the ninth century before the Christian æra. Few\\nthings, in my opinion, can be more improbable; and Mr. Payne Knight,\\nopposed as he is to the Wolfian hypothesis, admits this no less than\\nWolf himself. The traces of writing in Greece, even in the seventh\\ncentury before the Christian æra, are exceedingly trifling. We have no\\nremaining inscription earlier than the fortieth Olympiad, and the early\\ninscriptions are rude and unskilfully executed; nor can we even assure\\nourselves whether Archilochus, Simonidês of Amorgus, Kallinus,\\nTyrtæus, Xanthus, and the other early elegiac and lyric poets,\\ncommitted their compositions to writing, or at what time the practice\\nof doing so became familiar. The first positive ground which authorizes\\nus to presume the existence of a manuscript of Homer, is in the famous\\nordinance of Solôn, with regard to the rhapsodies at the Panathenæa:\\nbut for what length of time previously manuscripts had existed, we are\\nunable to say.\\n\\n“Those who maintain the Homeric poems to have been written from the\\nbeginning, rest their case, not upon positive proofs, nor yet upon the\\nexisting habits of society with regard to poetry—for they admit\\ngenerally that the Iliad and Odyssey were not read, but recited and\\nheard,—but upon the supposed necessity that there must have been\\nmanuscripts to ensure the preservation of the poems—the unassisted\\nmemory of reciters being neither sufficient nor trustworthy. But here\\nwe only escape a smaller difficulty by running into a greater; for the\\nexistence of trained bards, gifted with extraordinary memory,[25] is\\nfar less astonishing than that of long manuscripts, in an age\\nessentially non-reading and non-writing, and when even suitable\\ninstruments and materials for the process are not obvious. Moreover,\\nthere is a strong positive reason for believing that the bard was under\\nno necessity of refreshing his memory by consulting a manuscript; for\\nif such had been the fact, blindness would have been a disqualification\\nfor the profession, which we know that it was not, as well from the\\nexample of Demodokus, in the Odyssey, as from that of the blind bard of\\nChios, in the Hymn to the Delian Apollo, whom Thucydides, as well as\\nthe general tenor of Grecian legend, identifies with Homer himself. The\\nauthor of that hymn, be he who he may, could never have described a\\nblind man as attaining the utmost perfection in his art, if he had been\\nconscious that the memory of the bard was only maintained by constant\\nreference to the manuscript in his chest.”\\n\\nThe loss of the digamma, that _crux_ of critics, that quicksand upon\\nwhich even the acumen of Bentley was shipwrecked, seems to prove beyond\\na doubt, that the pronunciation of the Greek language had undergone a\\nconsiderable change. Now it is certainly difficult to suppose that the\\nHomeric poems could have suffered by this change, had written copies\\nbeen preserved. If Chaucer’s poetry, for instance, had not been\\nwritten, it could only have come down to us in a softened form, more\\nlike the effeminate version of Dryden, than the rough, quaint, noble\\noriginal.\\n\\n“At what period,” continues Grote, “these poems, or indeed any other\\nGreek poems, first began to be written, must be matter of conjecture,\\nthough there is ground for assurance that it was before the time of\\nSolôn. If, in the absence of evidence, we may venture upon naming any\\nmore determinate period, the question at once suggests itself, What\\nwere the purposes which, in that state of society, a manuscript at its\\nfirst commencement must have been intended to answer? For whom was a\\nwritten Iliad necessary? Not for the rhapsodes; for with them it was\\nnot only planted in the memory, but also interwoven with the feelings,\\nand conceived in conjunction with all those flexions and intonations of\\nvoice, pauses, and other oral artifices which were required for\\nemphatic delivery, and which the naked manuscript could never\\nreproduce. Not for the general public—they were accustomed to receive\\nit with its rhapsodic delivery, and with its accompaniments of a solemn\\nand crowded festival. The only persons for whom the written Iliad would\\nbe suitable would be a select few; studious and curious men; a class of\\nreaders capable of analyzing the complicated emotions which they had\\nexperienced as hearers in the crowd, and who would, on perusing the\\nwritten words, realize in their imaginations a sensible portion of the\\nimpression communicated by the reciter. Incredible as the statement may\\nseem in an age like the present, there is in all early societies, and\\nthere was in early Greece, a time when no such reading class existed.\\nIf we could discover at what time such a class first began to be\\nformed, we should be able to make a guess at the time when the old epic\\npoems were first committed to writing. Now the period which may with\\nthe greatest probability be fixed upon as having first witnessed the\\nformation even of the narrowest reading class in Greece, is the middle\\nof the seventh century before the Christian æra (B.C. 660 to B.C.\\n630), the age of Terpander, Kallinus, Archilochus, Simonidês of\\nAmorgus, &c. I ground this supposition on the change then operated in\\nthe character and tendencies of Grecian poetry and music—the elegiac\\nand the iambic measures having been introduced as rivals to the\\nprimitive hexameter, and poetical compositions having been transferred\\nfrom the epical past to the affairs of present and real life. Such a\\nchange was important at a time when poetry was the only known mode of\\npublication (to use a modern phrase not altogether suitable, yet the\\nnearest approaching to the sense). It argued a new way of looking at\\nthe old epical treasures of the people as well as a thirst for new\\npoetical effect; and the men who stood forward in it, may well be\\nconsidered as desirous to study, and competent to criticize, from their\\nown individual point of view, the written words of the Homeric\\nrhapsodies, just as we are told that Kallinus both noticed and\\neulogized the Thebaïs as the production of Homer. There seems,\\ntherefore, ground for conjecturing that (for the use of this\\nnewly-formed and important, but very narrow class), manuscripts of the\\nHomeric poems and other old epics,—the Thebaïs and the Cypria, as well\\nas the Iliad and the Odyssey,—began to be compiled towards the middle\\nof the seventh century (B.C. 1); and the opening of Egypt to Grecian\\ncommerce, which took place about the same period, would furnish\\nincreased facilities for obtaining the requisite papyrus to write upon.\\nA reading class, when once formed, would doubtless slowly increase, and\\nthe number of manuscripts along with it; so that before the time of\\nSolôn, fifty years afterwards, both readers and manuscripts, though\\nstill comparatively few, might have attained a certain recognized\\nauthority, and formed a tribunal of reference against the carelessness\\nof individual rhapsodes.”[26]\\n\\nBut even Peisistratus has not been suffered to remain in possession of\\nthe credit, and we cannot help feeling the force of the following\\nobservations—\\n\\n“There are several incidental circumstances which, in our opinion,\\nthrow some suspicion over the whole history of the Peisistratid\\ncompilation, at least over the theory, that the Iliad was cast into its\\npresent stately and harmonious form by the directions of the Athenian\\nruler. If the great poets, who flourished at the bright period of\\nGrecian song, of which, alas! we have inherited little more than the\\nfame, and the faint echo, if Stesichorus, Anacreon, and Simonidês were\\nemployed in the noble task of compiling the Iliad and Odyssey, so much\\nmust have been done to arrange, to connect, to harmonize, that it is\\nalmost incredible, that stronger marks of Athenian manufacture should\\nnot remain. Whatever occasional anomalies may be detected, anomalies\\nwhich no doubt arise out of our own ignorance of the language of the\\nHomeric age, however the irregular use of the digamma may have\\nperplexed our Bentleys, to whom the name of Helen is said to have\\ncaused as much disquiet and distress as the fair one herself among the\\nheroes of her age, however Mr. Knight may have failed in reducing the\\nHomeric language to its primitive form; however, finally, the Attic\\ndialect may not have assumed all its more marked and distinguishing\\ncharacteristics—still it is difficult to suppose that the language,\\nparticularly in the joinings and transitions, and connecting parts,\\nshould not more clearly betray the incongruity between the more ancient\\nand modern forms of expression. It is not quite in character with such\\na period to imitate an antique style, in order to piece out an\\nimperfect poem in the character of the original, as Sir Walter Scott\\nhas done in his continuation of Sir Tristram.\\n\\n“If, however, not even such faint and indistinct traces of Athenian\\ncompilation are discoverable in the language of the poems, the total\\nabsence of Athenian national feeling is perhaps no less worthy of\\nobservation. In later, and it may fairly be suspected in earlier times,\\nthe Athenians were more than ordinarily jealous of the fame of their\\nancestors. But, amid all the traditions of the glories of early Greece\\nembodied in the Iliad, the Athenians play a most subordinate and\\ninsignificant part. Even the few passages which relate to their\\nancestors, Mr. Knight suspects to be interpolations. It is possible,\\nindeed, that in its leading outline, the Iliad may be true to historic\\nfact, that in the great maritime expedition of western Greece against\\nthe rival and half-kindred empire of the Laomedontiadæ, the chieftain\\nof Thessaly, from his valour and the number of his forces, may have\\nbeen the most important ally of the Peloponnesian sovereign; the\\npreeminent value of the ancient poetry on the Trojan war may thus have\\nforced the national feeling of the Athenians to yield to their taste.\\nThe songs which spoke of their own great ancestor were, no doubt, of\\nfar inferior sublimity and popularity, or, at first sight, a Theseid\\nwould have been much more likely to have emanated from an Athenian\\nsynod of compilers of ancient song, than an Achilleid or an Olysseid.\\nCould France have given birth to a Tasso, Tancred would have been the\\nhero of the Jerusalem. If, however, the Homeric ballads, as they are\\nsometimes called, which related the wrath of Achilles, with all its\\ndireful consequences, were so far superior to the rest of the poetic\\ncycle, as to admit no rivalry,—it is still surprising, that throughout\\nthe whole poem the callida junctura should never betray the workmanship\\nof an Athenian hand, and that the national spirit of a race, who have\\nat a later period not inaptly been compared to our self admiring\\nneighbours, the French, should submit with lofty self denial to the\\nalmost total exclusion of their own ancestors—or, at least, to the\\nquestionable dignity of only having produced a leader tolerably skilled\\nin the military tactics of his age.”[27]\\n\\nTo return to the Wolfian theory. While it is to be confessed, that\\nWolf’s objections to the primitive integrity of the Iliad and Odyssey\\nhave never been wholly got over, we cannot help discovering that they\\nhave failed to enlighten us as to any substantial point, and that the\\ndifficulties with which the whole subject is beset, are rather\\naugmented than otherwise, if we admit his hypothesis. Nor is\\nLachmann’s[28] modification of his theory any better. He divides the\\nfirst twenty-two books of the Iliad into sixteen different songs, and\\ntreats as ridiculous the belief that their amalgamation into one\\nregular poem belongs to a period earlier than the age of Peisistratus.\\nThis, as Grote observes, “explains the gaps and contradictions in the\\nnarrative, but it explains nothing else.” Moreover, we find no\\ncontradictions warranting this belief, and the so-called sixteen poets\\nconcur in getting rid of the following leading men in the first battle\\nafter the secession of Achilles: Elphenor, chief of the Eubœans;\\nTlepolemus, of the Rhodians; Pandarus, of the Lycians; Odius, of the\\nHalizonians; Pirous and Acamas, of the Thracians. None of these heroes\\nagain make their appearance, and we can but agree with Colonel Mure,\\nthat “it seems strange that any number of independent poets should have\\nso harmoniously dispensed with the services of all six in the sequel.”\\nThe discrepancy, by which Pylæmenes, who is represented as dead in the\\nfifth book, weeps at his son’s funeral in the thirteenth, can only be\\nregarded as the result of an interpolation.\\n\\nGrote, although not very distinct in stating his own opinions on the\\nsubject, has done much to clearly show the incongruity of the Wolfian\\ntheory, and of Lachmann’s modifications with the character of\\nPeisistratus. But he has also shown, and we think with equal success,\\nthat the two questions relative to the primitive unity of these poems,\\nor, supposing that impossible, the unison of these parts by\\nPeisistratus, and not before his time, are essentially distinct. In\\nshort, “a man may believe the Iliad to have been put together out of\\npre-existing songs, without recognising the age of Peisistratus as the\\nperiod of its first compilation.” The friends or literary _employês_ of\\nPeisistratus must have found an Iliad that was already ancient, and the\\nsilence of the Alexandrine critics respecting the Peisistratic\\n“recension,” goes far to prove, that, among the numerous manuscripts\\nthey examined, this was either wanting, or thought unworthy of\\nattention.\\n\\n“Moreover,” he continues, “the whole tenor of the poems themselves\\nconfirms what is here remarked. There is nothing, either in the Iliad\\nor Odyssey, which savours of modernism, applying that term to the age\\nof Peisistratus—nothing which brings to our view the alterations\\nbrought about by two centuries, in the Greek language, the coined\\nmoney, the habits of writing and reading, the despotisms and republican\\ngovernments, the close military array, the improved construction of\\nships, the Amphiktyonic convocations, the mutual frequentation of\\nreligious festivals, the Oriental and Egyptian veins of religion, &c.,\\nfamiliar to the latter epoch. These alterations Onomakritus, and the\\nother literary friends of Peisistratus, could hardly have failed to\\nnotice, even without design, had they then, for the first time,\\nundertaken the task of piecing together many self existent epics into\\none large aggregate. Everything in the two great Homeric poems, both in\\nsubstance and in language, belongs to an age two or three centuries\\nearlier than Peisistratus. Indeed, even the interpolations (or those\\npassages which, on the best grounds, are pronounced to be such) betray\\nno trace of the sixth century before Christ, and may well have been\\nheard by Archilochus and Kallinus—in some cases even by Arktinus and\\nHesiod—as genuine Homeric matter.[29] As far as the evidences on the\\ncase, as well internal as external, enable us to judge, we seem\\nwarranted in believing that the Iliad and Odyssey were recited\\nsubstantially as they now stand (always allowing for partial\\ndivergences of text and interpolations) in 776 B.C., our first\\ntrustworthy mark of Grecian time; and this ancient date, let it be\\nadded, as it is the best-authenticated fact, so it is also the most\\nimportant attribute of the Homeric poems, considered in reference to\\nGrecian history; for they thus afford us an insight into the\\nanti-historical character of the Greeks, enabling us to trace the\\nsubsequent forward march of the nation, and to seize instructive\\ncontrasts between their former and their later condition.”[30]\\n\\nOn the whole, I am inclined to believe, that the labours of\\nPeisistratus were wholly of an editorial character, although, I must\\nconfess, that I can lay down nothing respecting the extent of his\\nlabours. At the same time, so far from believing that the composition\\nor primary arrangement of these poems, in their present form, was the\\nwork of Peisistratus, I am rather persuaded that the fine taste and\\nelegant mind of that Athenian[31] would lead him to preserve an ancient\\nand traditional order of the poems, rather than to patch and\\nre-construct them according to a fanciful hypothesis. I will not repeat\\nthe many discussions respecting whether the poems were written or not,\\nor whether the art of writing was known in the time of their reputed\\nauthor. Suffice it to say, that the more we read, the less satisfied we\\nare upon either subject.\\n\\nI cannot, however, help thinking, that the story which attributes the\\npreservation of these poems to Lycurgus, is little else than a version\\nof the same story as that of Peisistratus, while its historical\\nprobability must be measured by that of many others relating to the\\nSpartan Confucius.\\n\\nI will conclude this sketch of the Homeric theories, with an attempt,\\nmade by an ingenious friend, to unite them into something like\\nconsistency. It is as follows:—\\n\\n“No doubt the common soldiers of that age had, like the common sailors\\nof some fifty years ago, some one qualified to ‘discourse in excellent\\nmusic’ among them. Many of these, like those of the negroes in the\\nUnited States, were extemporaneous, and allusive to events passing\\naround them. But what was passing around them? The grand events of a\\nspirit-stirring war; occurrences likely to impress themselves, as the\\nmystical legends of former times had done, upon their memory; besides\\nwhich, a retentive memory was deemed a virtue of the first water, and\\nwas cultivated accordingly in those ancient times. Ballads at first,\\nand down to the beginning of the war with Troy, were merely\\nrecitations, with an intonation. Then followed a species of recitative,\\nprobably with an intoned burden. Tune next followed, as it aided the\\nmemory considerably.\\n\\n“It was at this period, about four hundred years after the war, that a\\npoet flourished of the name of Melesigenes, or Mœonides, but most\\nprobably the former. He saw that these ballads might be made of great\\nutility to his purpose of writing a poem on the social position of\\nHellas, and, as a collection, he published these lays, connecting them\\nby a tale of his own. This poem now exists, under the title of the\\n‘Odyssea.’ The author, however, did not affix his own name to the poem,\\nwhich, in fact, was, great part of it, remodelled from the archaic\\ndialect of Crete, in which tongue the ballads were found by him. He\\ntherefore called it the poem of Homeros, or the Collector; but this is\\nrather a proof of his modesty and talent, than of his mere drudging\\narrangement of other people’s ideas; for, as Grote has finely observed,\\narguing for the unity of authorship, ‘a great poet might have re-cast\\npre-existing separate songs into one comprehensive whole; but no mere\\narrangers or compilers would be competent to do so.’\\n\\n“While employed on the wild legend of Odysseus, he met with a ballad,\\nrecording the quarrel of Achilles and Agamemnon. His noble mind seized\\nthe hint that there presented itself, and the Achilleïs[32] grew under\\nhis hand. Unity of design, however, caused him to publish the poem\\nunder the same pseudonyme as his former work: and the disjointed lays\\nof the ancient bards were joined together, like those relating to the\\nCid, into a chronicle history, named the Iliad. Melesigenes knew that\\nthe poem was destined to be a lasting one, and so it has proved; but,\\nfirst, the poems were destined to undergo many vicissitudes and\\ncorruptions, by the people who took to singing them in the streets,\\nassemblies, and agoras. However, Solôn first, and then Peisistratus,\\nand afterwards Aristoteles and others, revised the poems, and restored\\nthe works of Melesigenes Homeros to their original integrity in a great\\nmeasure.”[33]\\n\\nHaving thus given some general notion of the strange theories which\\nhave developed themselves respecting this most interesting subject, I\\nmust still express my conviction as to the unity of the authorship of\\nthe Homeric poems. To deny that many corruptions and interpolations\\ndisfigure them, and that the intrusive hand of the poetasters may here\\nand there have inflicted a wound more serious than the negligence of\\nthe copyist, would be an absurd and captious assumption, but it is to a\\nhigher criticism that we must appeal, if we would either understand or\\nenjoy these poems. In maintaining the authenticity and personality of\\ntheir one author, be he Homer or Melesigenes, _quocunque nomine vocari\\neum jus fasque sit_, I feel conscious that, while the whole weight of\\nhistorical evidence is against the hypothesis which would assign these\\ngreat works to a plurality of authors, the most powerful internal\\nevidence, and that which springs from the deepest and most immediate\\nimpulse of the soul, also speaks eloquently to the contrary.\\n\\nThe minutiæ of verbal criticism I am far from seeking to despise.\\nIndeed, considering the character of some of my own books, such an\\nattempt would be gross inconsistency. But, while I appreciate its\\nimportance in a philological view, I am inclined to set little store on\\nits æsthetic value, especially in poetry. Three parts of the\\nemendations made upon poets are mere alterations, some of which, had\\nthey been suggested to the author by his Mæcenas or Africanus, he\\nwould probably have adopted. Moreover, those who are most exact in\\nlaying down rules of verbal criticism and interpretation, are often\\nleast competent to carry out their own precepts. Grammarians are not\\npoets by profession, but may be so _per accidens_. I do not at this\\nmoment remember two emendations on Homer, calculated to substantially\\nimprove the poetry of a passage, although a mass of remarks, from\\nHerodotus down to Loewe, have given us the history of a thousand minute\\npoints, without which our Greek knowledge would be gloomy and jejune.\\n\\nBut it is not on words only that grammarians, mere grammarians, will\\nexercise their elaborate and often tiresome ingenuity. Binding down an\\nheroic or dramatic poet to the block upon which they have previously\\ndissected his words and sentences, they proceed to use the axe and the\\npruning knife by wholesale, and inconsistent in everything but their\\nwish to make out a case of unlawful affiliation, they cut out book\\nafter book, passage after passage, till the author is reduced to a\\ncollection of fragments, or till those, who fancied they possessed the\\nworks of some great man, find that they have been put off with a vile\\ncounterfeit got up at second hand. If we compare the theories of\\nKnight, Wolf, Lachmann, and others, we shall feel better satisfied of\\nthe utter uncertainty of criticism than of the apocryphal position of\\nHomer. One rejects what another considers the turning-point of his\\ntheory. One cuts a supposed knot by expunging what another would\\nexplain by omitting something else.\\n\\nNor is this morbid species of sagacity by any means to be looked upon\\nas a literary novelty. Justus Lipsius, a scholar of no ordinary skill,\\nseems to revel in the imaginary discovery, that the tragedies\\nattributed to Seneca are by _four_ different authors.[34] Now, I will\\nventure to assert, that these tragedies are so uniform, not only in\\ntheir borrowed phraseology—a phraseology with which writers like\\nBoethius and Saxo Grammaticus were more charmed than ourselves—in their\\nfreedom from real poetry, and last, but not least, in an ultra-refined\\nand consistent abandonment of good taste, that few writers of the\\npresent day would question the capabilities of the same gentleman, be\\nhe Seneca or not, to produce not only these, but a great many more\\nequally bad. With equal sagacity, Father Hardouin astonished the world\\nwith the startling announcement that the Æneid of Virgil, and the\\nsatires of Horace, were literary deceptions. Now, without wishing to\\nsay one word of disrespect against the industry and learning—nay, the\\nrefined acuteness—which scholars, like Wolf, have bestowed upon this\\nsubject, I must express my fears, that many of our modern Homeric\\ntheories will become matter for the surprise and entertainment, rather\\nthan the instruction, of posterity. Nor can I help thinking, that the\\nliterary history of more recent times will account for many points of\\ndifficulty in the transmission of the Iliad and Odyssey to a period so\\nremote from that of their first creation.\\n\\nI have already expressed my belief that the labours of Peisistratus\\nwere of a purely editorial character; and there seems no more reason\\nwhy corrupt and imperfect editions of Homer may not have been abroad in\\nhis day, than that the poems of Valerius Flaccus and Tibullus should\\nhave given so much trouble to Poggio, Scaliger, and others. But, after\\nall, the main fault in all the Homeric theories is, that they demand\\ntoo great a sacrifice of those feelings to which poetry most powerfully\\nappeals, and which are its most fitting judges. The ingenuity which has\\nsought to rob us of the name and existence of Homer, does too much\\nviolence to that inward emotion, which makes our whole soul yearn with\\nlove and admiration for the blind bard of Chios. To believe the author\\nof the Iliad a mere compiler, is to degrade the powers of human\\ninvention; to elevate analytical judgment at the expense of the most\\nennobling impulses of the soul; and to forget the ocean in the\\ncontemplation of a polypus. There is a catholicity, so to speak, in the\\nvery name of Homer. Our faith in the author of the Iliad may be a\\nmistaken one, but as yet nobody has taught us a better.\\n\\nWhile, however, I look upon the belief in Homer as one that has nature\\nherself for its mainspring; while I can join with old Ennius in\\nbelieving in Homer as the ghost, who, like some patron saint, hovers\\nround the bed of the poet, and even bestows rare gifts from that wealth\\nof imagination which a host of imitators could not exhaust,—still I am\\nfar from wishing to deny that the author of these great poems found a\\nrich fund of tradition, a well-stocked mythical storehouse from whence\\nhe might derive both subject and embellishment. But it is one thing to\\n_use_ existing romances in the embellishment of a poem, another to\\npatch up the poem itself from such materials. What consistency of style\\nand execution can be hoped for from such an attempt? or, rather, what\\nbad taste and tedium will not be the infallible result?\\n\\nA blending of popular legends, and a free use of the songs of other\\nbards, are features perfectly consistent with poetical originality. In\\nfact, the most original writer is still drawing upon outward\\nimpressions—nay, even his own thoughts are a kind of secondary agents\\nwhich support and feed the impulses of imagination. But unless there be\\nsome grand pervading principle—some invisible, yet most distinctly\\nstamped archetypus of the great whole, a poem like the Iliad can never\\ncome to the birth. Traditions the most picturesque, episodes the most\\npathetic, local associations teeming with the thoughts of gods and\\ngreat men, may crowd in one mighty vision, or reveal themselves in more\\nsubstantial forms to the mind of the poet; but, except the power to\\ncreate a grand whole, to which these shall be but as details and\\nembellishments, be present, we shall have nought but a scrap-book, a\\nparterre filled with flowers and weeds strangling each other in their\\nwild redundancy: we shall have a cento of rags and tatters, which will\\nrequire little acuteness to detect.\\n\\nSensible as I am of the difficulty of disproving a negative, and aware\\nas I must be of the weighty grounds there are for opposing my belief,\\nit still seems to me that the Homeric question is one that is reserved\\nfor a higher criticism than it has often obtained. We are not by nature\\nintended to know all things; still less, to compass the powers by which\\nthe greatest blessings of life have been placed at our disposal. Were\\nfaith no virtue, then we might indeed wonder why God willed our\\nignorance on any matter. But we are too well taught the contrary\\nlesson; and it seems as though our faith should be especially tried\\ntouching the men and the events which have wrought most influence upon\\nthe condition of humanity. And there is a kind of sacredness attached\\nto the memory of the great and the good, which seems to bid us repulse\\nthe scepticism which would allegorize their existence into a pleasing\\napologue, and measure the giants of intellect by an homeopathic\\ndynameter.\\n\\nLong and habitual reading of Homer appears to familiarize our thoughts\\neven to his incongruities; or rather, if we read in a right spirit and\\nwith a heartfelt appreciation, we are too much dazzled, too deeply\\nwrapped in admiration of the whole, to dwell upon the minute spots\\nwhich mere analysis can discover. In reading an heroic poem we must\\ntransform ourselves into heroes of the time being, we in imagination\\nmust fight over the same battles, woo the same loves, burn with the\\nsame sense of injury, as an Achilles or a Hector. And if we can but\\nattain this degree of enthusiasm (and less enthusiasm will scarcely\\nsuffice for the reading of Homer), we shall feel that the poems of\\nHomer are not only the work of one writer, but of the greatest writer\\nthat ever touched the hearts of men by the power of song.\\n\\nAnd it was this supposed unity of authorship which gave these poems\\ntheir powerful influence over the minds of the men of old. Heeren, who\\nis evidently little disposed in favour of modern theories, finely\\nobserves:—\\n\\n“It was Homer who formed the character of the Greek nation. No poet has\\never, as a poet, exercised a similar influence over his countrymen.\\nProphets, lawgivers, and sages have formed the character of other\\nnations; it was reserved to a poet to form that of the Greeks. This is\\na feature in their character which was not wholly erased even in the\\nperiod of their degeneracy. When lawgivers and sages appeared in\\nGreece, the work of the poet had already been accomplished; and they\\npaid homage to his superior genius. He held up before his nation the\\nmirror, in which they were to behold the world of gods and heroes no\\nless than of feeble mortals, and to behold them reflected with purity\\nand truth. His poems are founded on the first feeling of human nature;\\non the love of children, wife, and country; on that passion which\\noutweighs all others, the love of glory. His songs were poured forth\\nfrom a breast which sympathized with all the feelings of man; and\\ntherefore they enter, and will continue to enter, every breast which\\ncherishes the same sympathies. If it is granted to his immortal spirit,\\nfrom another heaven than any of which he dreamed on earth, to look down\\non his race, to see the nations from the fields of Asia to the forests\\nof Hercynia, performing pilgrimages to the fountain which his magic\\nwand caused to flow; if it is permitted to him to view the vast\\nassemblage of grand, of elevated, of glorious productions, which had\\nbeen called into being by means of his songs; wherever his immortal\\nspirit may reside, this alone would suffice to complete his\\nhappiness.”[35]\\n\\nCan we contemplate that ancient monument, on which the “Apotheosis of\\nHomer”[36] is depictured, and not feel how much of pleasing\\nassociation, how much that appeals most forcibly and most distinctly to\\nour minds, is lost by the admittance of any theory but our old\\ntradition? The more we read, and the more we think—think as becomes the\\nreaders of Homer,—the more rooted becomes the conviction that the\\nFather of Poetry gave us this rich inheritance, whole and entire.\\nWhatever were the means of its preservation, let us rather be thankful\\nfor the treasury of taste and eloquence thus laid open to our use, than\\nseek to make it a mere centre around which to drive a series of\\ntheories, whose wildness is only equalled by their inconsistency with\\neach other.\\n\\nAs the hymns, and some other poems usually ascribed to Homer, are not\\nincluded in Pope’s translation, I will content myself with a brief\\naccount of the Battle of the Frogs and Mice, from the pen of a writer\\nwho has done it full justice[37]:—\\n\\n“This poem,” says Coleridge, “is a short mock-heroic of ancient date.\\nThe text varies in different editions, and is obviously disturbed and\\ncorrupt to a great degree; it is commonly said to have been a juvenile\\nessay of Homer’s genius; others have attributed it to the same Pigrees,\\nmentioned above, and whose reputation for humour seems to have invited\\nthe appropriation of any piece of ancient wit, the author of which was\\nuncertain; so little did the Greeks, before the age of the Ptolemies,\\nknow or care about that department of criticism employed in determining\\nthe genuineness of ancient writings. As to this little poem being a\\nyouthful profusion of Homer, it seems sufficient to say that from the\\nbeginning to the end it is a plain and palpable parody, not only of the\\ngeneral spirit, but of the numerous passages of the Iliad itself; and\\neven, if no such intention to parody were discernible in it, the\\nobjection would still remain, that to suppose a work of mere burlesque\\nto be the primary effort of poetry in a simple age, seems to reverse\\nthat order in the development of national taste, which the history of\\nevery other people in Europe, and of many in Asia, has almost\\nascertained to be a law of the human mind; it is in a state of society\\nmuch more refined and permanent than that described in the Iliad, that\\nany popularity would attend such a ridicule of war and the gods as is\\ncontained in this poem; and the fact of there having existed three\\nother poems of the same kind attributed, for aught we can see, with as\\nmuch reason to Homer, is a strong inducement to believe that none of\\nthem were of the Homeric age. Knight infers from the usage of the word\\ndeltos, “writing tablet,” instead of διφθέρα, “skin,” which, according\\nto Herod. 5, 58, was the material employed by the Asiatic Greeks for\\nthat purpose, that this poem was another offspring of Attic ingenuity;\\nand generally that the familiar mention of the cock (v. 191) is a\\nstrong argument against so ancient a date for its composition.”\\n\\nHaving thus given a brief account of the poems comprised in Pope’s\\ndesign, I will now proceed to make a few remarks on his translation,\\nand on my own purpose in the present edition.\\n\\nPope was not a Grecian. His whole education had been irregular, and his\\nearliest acquaintance with the poet was through the version of Ogilby.\\nIt is not too much to say that his whole work bears the impress of a\\ndisposition to be satisfied with the general sense, rather than to dive\\ndeeply into the minute and delicate features of language. Hence his\\nwhole work is to be looked upon rather as an elegant paraphrase than a\\ntranslation. There are, to be sure, certain conventional anecdotes,\\nwhich prove that Pope consulted various friends, whose classical\\nattainments were sounder than his own, during the undertaking; but it\\nis probable that these examinations were the result rather of the\\ncontradictory versions already existing, than of a desire to make a\\nperfect transcript of the original. And in those days, what is called\\nliteral translation was less cultivated than at present. If something\\nlike the general sense could be decorated with the easy gracefulness of\\na practised poet; if the charms of metrical cadence and a pleasing\\nfluency could be made consistent with a fair interpretation of the\\npoet’s meaning, his _words_ were less jealously sought for, and those\\nwho could read so good a poem as Pope’s Iliad had fair reason to be\\nsatisfied.\\n\\nIt would be absurd, therefore, to test Pope’s translation by our own\\nadvancing knowledge of the original text. We must be content to look at\\nit as a most delightful work in itself,—a work which is as much a part\\nof English literature as Homer himself is of Greek. We must not be torn\\nfrom our kindly associations with the old Iliad, that once was our most\\ncherished companion, or our most looked-for prize, merely because\\nButtmann, Loewe, and Liddell have made us so much more accurate as to\\nἀμφικύπελλον being an adjective, and not a substantive. Far be it from\\nus to defend the faults of Pope, especially when we think of Chapman’s\\nfine, bold, rough old English;—far be it from us to hold up his\\ntranslation as what a translation of Homer _might_ be. But we can still\\ndismiss Pope’s Iliad to the hands of our readers, with the\\nconsciousness that they must have read a very great number of books\\nbefore they have read its fellow.\\n\\nAs to the Notes accompanying the present volume, they are drawn up\\nwithout pretension, and mainly with the view of helping the general\\nreader. Having some little time since translated all the works of Homer\\nfor another publisher, I might have brought a large amount of\\naccumulated matter, sometimes of a critical character, to bear upon the\\ntext. But Pope’s version was no field for such a display; and my\\npurpose was to touch briefly on antiquarian or mythological allusions,\\nto notice occasionally _some_ departures from the original, and to give\\na few parallel passages from our English Homer, Milton. In the latter\\ntask I cannot pretend to novelty, but I trust that my other\\nannotations, while utterly disclaiming high scholastic views, will be\\nfound to convey as much as is wanted; at least, as far as the necessary\\nlimits of these volumes could be expected to admit. To write a\\ncommentary on Homer is not my present aim; but if I have made Pope’s\\ntranslation a little more entertaining and instructive to a mass of\\nmiscellaneous readers, I shall consider my wishes satisfactorily\\naccomplished.\\n\\nTHEODORE ALOIS BUCKLEY.\\n\\n\\n_Christ Church_.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPOPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER\\n\\n\\nHomer is universally allowed to have had the greatest invention of any\\nwriter whatever. The praise of judgment Virgil has justly contested\\nwith him, and others may have their pretensions as to particular\\nexcellences; but his invention remains yet unrivalled. Nor is it a\\nwonder if he has ever been acknowledged the greatest of poets, who most\\nexcelled in that which is the very foundation of poetry. It is the\\ninvention that, in different degrees, distinguishes all great geniuses:\\nthe utmost stretch of human study, learning, and industry, which\\nmasters everything besides, can never attain to this. It furnishes art\\nwith all her materials, and without it judgment itself can at best but\\n“steal wisely:” for art is only like a prudent steward that lives on\\nmanaging the riches of nature. Whatever praises may be given to works\\nof judgment, there is not even a single beauty in them to which the\\ninvention must not contribute: as in the most regular gardens, art can\\nonly reduce beauties of nature to more regularity, and such a figure,\\nwhich the common eye may better take in, and is, therefore, more\\nentertained with. And, perhaps, the reason why common critics are\\ninclined to prefer a judicious and methodical genius to a great and\\nfruitful one, is, because they find it easier for themselves to pursue\\ntheir observations through a uniform and bounded walk of art, than to\\ncomprehend the vast and various extent of nature.\\n\\nOur author’s work is a wild paradise, where, if we cannot see all the\\nbeauties so distinctly as in an ordered garden, it is only because the\\nnumber of them is infinitely greater. It is like a copious nursery,\\nwhich contains the seeds and first productions of every kind, out of\\nwhich those who followed him have but selected some particular plants,\\neach according to his fancy, to cultivate and beautify. If some things\\nare too luxuriant it is owing to the richness of the soil; and if\\nothers are not arrived to perfection or maturity, it is only because\\nthey are overrun and oppressed by those of a stronger nature.\\n\\nIt is to the strength of this amazing invention we are to attribute\\nthat unequalled fire and rapture which is so forcible in Homer, that no\\nman of a true poetical spirit is master of himself while he reads him.\\nWhat he writes is of the most animated nature imaginable; every thing\\nmoves, every thing lives, and is put in action. If a council be called,\\nor a battle fought, you are not coldly informed of what was said or\\ndone as from a third person; the reader is hurried out of himself by\\nthe force of the poet’s imagination, and turns in one place to a\\nhearer, in another to a spectator. The course of his verses resembles\\nthat of the army he describes,\\n\\n    Οἵδ’ ἄῤ ἴσαν, ὡσεί τε πυρὶ χθὼν πἆσα νέμοιτο.\\n\\n“They pour along like a fire that sweeps the whole earth before it.” It\\nis, however, remarkable, that his fancy, which is everywhere vigorous,\\nis not discovered immediately at the beginning of his poem in its\\nfullest splendour: it grows in the progress both upon himself and\\nothers, and becomes on fire, like a chariot-wheel, by its own rapidity.\\nExact disposition, just thought, correct elocution, polished numbers,\\nmay have been found in a thousand; but this poetic fire, this “vivida\\nvis animi,” in a very few. Even in works where all those are imperfect\\nor neglected, this can overpower criticism, and make us admire even\\nwhile we disapprove. Nay, where this appears, though attended with\\nabsurdities, it brightens all the rubbish about it, till we see nothing\\nbut its own splendour. This fire is discerned in Virgil, but discerned\\nas through a glass, reflected from Homer, more shining than fierce, but\\neverywhere equal and constant: in Lucan and Statius it bursts out in\\nsudden, short, and interrupted flashes: In Milton it glows like a\\nfurnace kept up to an uncommon ardour by the force of art: in\\nShakspeare it strikes before we are aware, like an accidental fire from\\nheaven: but in Homer, and in him only, it burns everywhere clearly and\\neverywhere irresistibly.\\n\\nI shall here endeavour to show how this vast invention exerts itself in\\na manner superior to that of any poet through all the main constituent\\nparts of his work: as it is the great and peculiar characteristic which\\ndistinguishes him from all other authors.\\n\\nThis strong and ruling faculty was like a powerful star, which, in the\\nviolence of its course, drew all things within its vortex. It seemed\\nnot enough to have taken in the whole circle of arts, and the whole\\ncompass of nature, to supply his maxims and reflections; all the inward\\npassions and affections of mankind, to furnish his characters: and all\\nthe outward forms and images of things for his descriptions: but\\nwanting yet an ampler sphere to expatiate in, he opened a new and\\nboundless walk for his imagination, and created a world for himself in\\nthe invention of fable. That which Aristotle calls “the soul of\\npoetry,” was first breathed into it by Homer. I shall begin with\\nconsidering him in his part, as it is naturally the first; and I speak\\nof it both as it means the design of a poem, and as it is taken for\\nfiction.\\n\\n\\nFable may be divided into the probable, the allegorical, and the\\nmarvellous. The probable fable is the recital of such actions as,\\nthough they did not happen, yet might, in the common course of nature;\\nor of such as, though they did, became fables by the additional\\nepisodes and manner of telling them. Of this sort is the main story of\\nan epic poem, “The return of Ulysses, the settlement of the Trojans in\\nItaly,” or the like. That of the Iliad is the “anger of Achilles,” the\\nmost short and single subject that ever was chosen by any poet. Yet\\nthis he has supplied with a vaster variety of incidents and events, and\\ncrowded with a greater number of councils, speeches, battles, and\\nepisodes of all kinds, than are to be found even in those poems whose\\nschemes are of the utmost latitude and irregularity. The action is\\nhurried on with the most vehement spirit, and its whole duration\\nemploys not so much as fifty days. Virgil, for want of so warm a\\ngenius, aided himself by taking in a more extensive subject, as well as\\na greater length of time, and contracting the design of both Homer’s\\npoems into one, which is yet but a fourth part as large as his. The\\nother epic poets have used the same practice, but generally carried it\\nso far as to superinduce a multiplicity of fables, destroy the unity of\\naction, and lose their readers in an unreasonable length of time. Nor\\nis it only in the main design that they have been unable to add to his\\ninvention, but they have followed him in every episode and part of\\nstory. If he has given a regular catalogue of an army, they all draw up\\ntheir forces in the same order. If he has funeral games for Patroclus,\\nVirgil has the same for Anchises, and Statius (rather than omit them)\\ndestroys the unity of his actions for those of Archemorus. If Ulysses\\nvisit the shades, the Æneas of Virgil and Scipio of Silius are sent\\nafter him. If he be detained from his return by the allurements of\\nCalypso, so is Æneas by Dido, and Rinaldo by Armida. If Achilles be\\nabsent from the army on the score of a quarrel through half the poem,\\nRinaldo must absent himself just as long on the like account. If he\\ngives his hero a suit of celestial armour, Virgil and Tasso make the\\nsame present to theirs. Virgil has not only observed this close\\nimitation of Homer, but, where he had not led the way, supplied the\\nwant from other Greek authors. Thus the story of Sinon, and the taking\\nof Troy, was copied (says Macrobius) almost word for word from\\nPisander, as the loves of Dido and Æneas are taken from those of Medea\\nand Jason in Apollonius, and several others in the same manner.\\n\\n\\nTo proceed to the allegorical fable—If we reflect upon those\\ninnumerable knowledges, those secrets of nature and physical philosophy\\nwhich Homer is generally supposed to have wrapped up in his allegories,\\nwhat a new and ample scene of wonder may this consideration afford us!\\nHow fertile will that imagination appear, which was able to clothe all\\nthe properties of elements, the qualifications of the mind, the virtues\\nand vices, in forms and persons, and to introduce them into actions\\nagreeable to the nature of the things they shadowed! This is a field in\\nwhich no succeeding poets could dispute with Homer, and whatever\\ncommendations have been allowed them on this head, are by no means for\\ntheir invention in having enlarged his circle, but for their judgment\\nin having contracted it. For when the mode of learning changed in the\\nfollowing ages, and science was delivered in a plainer manner, it then\\nbecame as reasonable in the more modern poets to lay it aside, as it\\nwas in Homer to make use of it. And perhaps it was no unhappy\\ncircumstance for Virgil, that there was not in his time that demand\\nupon him of so great an invention as might be capable of furnishing all\\nthose allegorical parts of a poem.\\n\\n\\nThe marvellous fable includes whatever is supernatural, and especially\\nthe machines of the gods. If Homer was not the first who introduced the\\ndeities (as Herodotus imagines) into the religion of Greece, he seems\\nthe first who brought them into a system of machinery for poetry, and\\nsuch a one as makes its greatest importance and dignity: for we find\\nthose authors who have been offended at the literal notion of the gods,\\nconstantly laying their accusation against Homer as the chief support\\nof it. But whatever cause there might be to blame his machines in a\\nphilosophical or religious view, they are so perfect in the poetic,\\nthat mankind have been ever since contented to follow them: none have\\nbeen able to enlarge the sphere of poetry beyond the limits he has set:\\nevery attempt of this nature has proved unsuccessful; and after all the\\nvarious changes of times and religions, his gods continue to this day\\nthe gods of poetry.\\n\\n\\nWe come now to the characters of his persons; and here we shall find no\\nauthor has ever drawn so many, with so visible and surprising a\\nvariety, or given us such lively and affecting impressions of them.\\nEvery one has something so singularly his own, that no painter could\\nhave distinguished them more by their features, than the poet has by\\ntheir manners. Nothing can be more exact than the distinctions he has\\nobserved in the different degrees of virtues and vices. The single\\nquality of courage is wonderfully diversified in the several characters\\nof the Iliad. That of Achilles is furious and intractable; that of\\nDiomede forward, yet listening to advice, and subject to command; that\\nof Ajax is heavy and self-confiding; of Hector, active and vigilant:\\nthe courage of Agamemnon is inspirited by love of empire and ambition;\\nthat of Menelaus mixed with softness and tenderness for his people: we\\nfind in Idomeneus a plain direct soldier; in Sarpedon a gallant and\\ngenerous one. Nor is this judicious and astonishing diversity to be\\nfound only in the principal quality which constitutes the main of each\\ncharacter, but even in the under parts of it, to which he takes care to\\ngive a tincture of that principal one. For example: the main characters\\nof Ulysses and Nestor consist in wisdom; and they are distinct in this,\\nthat the wisdom of one is artificial and various, of the other natural,\\nopen, and regular. But they have, besides, characters of courage; and\\nthis quality also takes a different turn in each from the difference of\\nhis prudence; for one in the war depends still upon caution, the other\\nupon experience. It would be endless to produce instances of these\\nkinds. The characters of Virgil are far from striking us in this open\\nmanner; they lie, in a great degree, hidden and undistinguished; and,\\nwhere they are marked most evidently affect us not in proportion to\\nthose of Homer. His characters of valour are much alike; even that of\\nTurnus seems no way peculiar, but, as it is, in a superior degree; and\\nwe see nothing that differences the courage of Mnestheus from that of\\nSergestus, Cloanthus, or the rest. In like manner it may be remarked of\\nStatius’s heroes, that an air of impetuosity runs through them all; the\\nsame horrid and savage courage appears in his Capaneus, Tydeus,\\nHippomedon, &c. They have a parity of character, which makes them seem\\nbrothers of one family. I believe when the reader is led into this\\ntract of reflection, if he will pursue it through the epic and tragic\\nwriters, he will be convinced how infinitely superior, in this point,\\nthe invention of Homer was to that of all others.\\n\\n\\nThe speeches are to be considered as they flow from the characters;\\nbeing perfect or defective as they agree or disagree with the manners,\\nof those who utter them. As there is more variety of characters in the\\nIliad, so there is of speeches, than in any other poem. “Everything in\\nit has manner” (as Aristotle expresses it), that is, everything is\\nacted or spoken. It is hardly credible, in a work of such length, how\\nsmall a number of lines are employed in narration. In Virgil the\\ndramatic part is less in proportion to the narrative, and the speeches\\noften consist of general reflections or thoughts, which might be\\nequally just in any person’s mouth upon the same occasion. As many of\\nhis persons have no apparent characters, so many of his speeches escape\\nbeing applied and judged by the rule of propriety. We oftener think of\\nthe author himself when we read Virgil, than when we are engaged in\\nHomer, all which are the effects of a colder invention, that interests\\nus less in the action described. Homer makes us hearers, and Virgil\\nleaves us readers.\\n\\n\\nIf, in the next place, we take a view of the sentiments, the same\\npresiding faculty is eminent in the sublimity and spirit of his\\nthoughts. Longinus has given his opinion, that it was in this part\\nHomer principally excelled. What were alone sufficient to prove the\\ngrandeur and excellence of his sentiments in general, is, that they\\nhave so remarkable a parity with those of the Scripture. Duport, in his\\nGnomologia Homerica, has collected innumerable instances of this sort.\\nAnd it is with justice an excellent modern writer allows, that if\\nVirgil has not so many thoughts that are low and vulgar, he has not so\\nmany that are sublime and noble; and that the Roman author seldom rises\\ninto very astonishing sentiments where he is not fired by the Iliad.\\n\\n\\nIf we observe his descriptions, images, and similes, we shall find the\\ninvention still predominant. To what else can we ascribe that vast\\ncomprehension of images of every sort, where we see each circumstance\\nof art, and individual of nature, summoned together by the extent and\\nfecundity of his imagination to which all things, in their various\\nviews presented themselves in an instant, and had their impressions\\ntaken off to perfection at a heat? Nay, he not only gives us the full\\nprospects of things, but several unexpected peculiarities and side\\nviews, unobserved by any painter but Homer. Nothing is so surprising as\\nthe descriptions of his battles, which take up no less than half the\\nIliad, and are supplied with so vast a variety of incidents, that no\\none bears a likeness to another; such different kinds of deaths, that\\nno two heroes are wounded in the same manner, and such a profusion of\\nnoble ideas, that every battle rises above the last in greatness,\\nhorror, and confusion. It is certain there is not near that number of\\nimages and descriptions in any epic poet, though every one has assisted\\nhimself with a great quantity out of him; and it is evident of Virgil\\nespecially, that he has scarce any comparisons which are not drawn from\\nhis master.\\n\\n\\nIf we descend from hence to the expression, we see the bright\\nimagination of Homer shining out in the most enlivened forms of it. We\\nacknowledge him the father of poetical diction; the first who taught\\nthat “language of the gods” to men. His expression is like the\\ncolouring of some great masters, which discovers itself to be laid on\\nboldly, and executed with rapidity. It is, indeed, the strongest and\\nmost glowing imaginable, and touched with the greatest spirit.\\nAristotle had reason to say, he was the only poet who had found out\\n“living words;” there are in him more daring figures and metaphors than\\nin any good author whatever. An arrow is “impatient” to be on the wing,\\na weapon “thirsts” to drink the blood of an enemy, and the like, yet\\nhis expression is never too big for the sense, but justly great in\\nproportion to it. It is the sentiment that swells and fills out the\\ndiction, which rises with it, and forms itself about it, for in the\\nsame degree that a thought is warmer, an expression will be brighter,\\nas that is more strong, this will become more perspicuous; like glass\\nin the furnace, which grows to a greater magnitude, and refines to a\\ngreater clearness, only as the breath within is more powerful, and the\\nheat more intense.\\n\\n\\nTo throw his language more out of prose, Homer seems to have affected\\nthe compound epithets. This was a sort of composition peculiarly proper\\nto poetry, not only as it heightened the diction, but as it assisted\\nand filled the numbers with greater sound and pomp, and likewise\\nconduced in some measure to thicken the images. On this last\\nconsideration I cannot but attribute these also to the fruitfulness of\\nhis invention, since (as he has managed them) they are a sort of\\nsupernumerary pictures of the persons or things to which they were\\njoined. We see the motion of Hector’s plumes in the epithet\\nΚορυθαίολος, the landscape of Mount Neritus in that of Εἰνοσίφυλλος,\\nand so of others, which particular images could not have been insisted\\nupon so long as to express them in a description (though but of a\\nsingle line) without diverting the reader too much from the principal\\naction or figure. As a metaphor is a short simile, one of these\\nepithets is a short description.\\n\\n\\nLastly, if we consider his versification, we shall be sensible what a\\nshare of praise is due to his invention in that also. He was not\\nsatisfied with his language as he found it settled in any one part of\\nGreece, but searched through its different dialects with this\\nparticular view, to beautify and perfect his numbers he considered\\nthese as they had a greater mixture of vowels or consonants, and\\naccordingly employed them as the verse required either a greater\\nsmoothness or strength. What he most affected was the Ionic, which has\\na peculiar sweetness, from its never using contractions, and from its\\ncustom of resolving the diphthongs into two syllables, so as to make\\nthe words open themselves with a more spreading and sonorous fluency.\\nWith this he mingled the Attic contractions, the broader Doric, and the\\nfeebler Æolic, which often rejects its aspirate, or takes off its\\naccent, and completed this variety by altering some letters with the\\nlicence of poetry. Thus his measures, instead of being fetters to his\\nsense, were always in readiness to run along with the warmth of his\\nrapture, and even to give a further representation of his notions, in\\nthe correspondence of their sounds to what they signified. Out of all\\nthese he has derived that harmony which makes us confess he had not\\nonly the richest head, but the finest ear in the world. This is so\\ngreat a truth, that whoever will but consult the tune of his verses,\\neven without understanding them (with the same sort of diligence as we\\ndaily see practised in the case of Italian operas), will find more\\nsweetness, variety, and majesty of sound, than in any other language of\\npoetry. The beauty of his numbers is allowed by the critics to be\\ncopied but faintly by Virgil himself, though they are so just as to\\nascribe it to the nature of the Latin tongue: indeed the Greek has some\\nadvantages both from the natural sound of its words, and the turn and\\ncadence of its verse, which agree with the genius of no other language.\\nVirgil was very sensible of this, and used the utmost diligence in\\nworking up a more intractable language to whatsoever graces it was\\ncapable of, and, in particular, never failed to bring the sound of his\\nline to a beautiful agreement with its sense. If the Grecian poet has\\nnot been so frequently celebrated on this account as the Roman, the\\nonly reason is, that fewer critics have understood one language than\\nthe other. Dionysius of Halicarnassus has pointed out many of our\\nauthor’s beauties in this kind, in his treatise of the Composition of\\nWords. It suffices at present to observe of his numbers, that they flow\\nwith so much ease, as to make one imagine Homer had no other care than\\nto transcribe as fast as the Muses dictated, and, at the same time,\\nwith so much force and inspiriting vigour, that they awaken and raise\\nus like the sound of a trumpet. They roll along as a plentiful river,\\nalways in motion, and always full; while we are borne away by a tide of\\nverse, the most rapid, and yet the most smooth imaginable.\\n\\n\\nThus on whatever side we contemplate Homer, what principally strikes us\\nis his invention. It is that which forms the character of each part of\\nhis work; and accordingly we find it to have made his fable more\\nextensive and copious than any other, his manners more lively and\\nstrongly marked, his speeches more affecting and transported, his\\nsentiments more warm and sublime, his images and descriptions more full\\nand animated, his expression more raised and daring, and his numbers\\nmore rapid and various. I hope, in what has been said of Virgil, with\\nregard to any of these heads, I have no way derogated from his\\ncharacter. Nothing is more absurd or endless, than the common method of\\ncomparing eminent writers by an opposition of particular passages in\\nthem, and forming a judgment from thence of their merit upon the whole.\\nWe ought to have a certain knowledge of the principal character and\\ndistinguishing excellence of each: it is in that we are to consider\\nhim, and in proportion to his degree in that we are to admire him. No\\nauthor or man ever excelled all the world in more than one faculty; and\\nas Homer has done this in invention, Virgil has in judgment. Not that\\nwe are to think that Homer wanted judgment, because Virgil had it in a\\nmore eminent degree; or that Virgil wanted invention, because Homer\\npossessed a larger share of it; each of these great authors had more of\\nboth than perhaps any man besides, and are only said to have less in\\ncomparison with one another. Homer was the greater genius, Virgil the\\nbetter artist. In one we most admire the man, in the other the work.\\nHomer hurries and transports us with a commanding impetuosity; Virgil\\nleads us with an attractive majesty; Homer scatters with a generous\\nprofusion; Virgil bestows with a careful magnificence; Homer, like the\\nNile, pours out his riches with a boundless overflow; Virgil, like a\\nriver in its banks, with a gentle and constant stream. When we behold\\ntheir battles, methinks the two poets resemble the heroes they\\ncelebrate. Homer, boundless and resistless as Achilles, bears all\\nbefore him, and shines more and more as the tumult increases; Virgil,\\ncalmly daring, like Æneas, appears undisturbed in the midst of the\\naction; disposes all about him, and conquers with tranquillity. And\\nwhen we look upon their machines, Homer seems like his own Jupiter in\\nhis terrors, shaking Olympus, scattering the lightnings, and firing the\\nheavens: Virgil, like the same power in his benevolence, counselling\\nwith the gods, laying plans for empires, and regularly ordering his\\nwhole creation.\\n\\n\\nBut after all, it is with great parts, as with great virtues, they\\nnaturally border on some imperfection; and it is often hard to\\ndistinguish exactly where the virtue ends, or the fault begins. As\\nprudence may sometimes sink to suspicion, so may a great judgment\\ndecline to coldness; and as magnanimity may run up to profusion or\\nextravagance, so may a great invention to redundancy or wildness. If we\\nlook upon Homer in this view, we shall perceive the chief objections\\nagainst him to proceed from so noble a cause as the excess of this\\nfaculty.\\n\\n\\nAmong these we may reckon some of his marvellous fictions, upon which\\nso much criticism has been spent, as surpassing all the bounds of\\nprobability. Perhaps it may be with great and superior souls, as with\\ngigantic bodies, which, exerting themselves with unusual strength,\\nexceed what is commonly thought the due proportion of parts, to become\\nmiracles in the whole; and, like the old heroes of that make, commit\\nsomething near extravagance, amidst a series of glorious and inimitable\\nperformances. Thus Homer has his “speaking horses;” and Virgil his\\n“myrtles distilling blood;” where the latter has not so much as\\ncontrived the easy intervention of a deity to save the probability.\\n\\n\\nIt is owing to the same vast invention, that his similes have been\\nthought too exuberant and full of circumstances. The force of this\\nfaculty is seen in nothing more, than in its inability to confine\\nitself to that single circumstance upon which the comparison is\\ngrounded: it runs out into embellishments of additional images, which,\\nhowever, are so managed as not to overpower the main one. His similes\\nare like pictures, where the principal figure has not only its\\nproportion given agreeable to the original, but is also set off with\\noccasional ornaments and prospects. The same will account for his\\nmanner of heaping a number of comparisons together in one breath, when\\nhis fancy suggested to him at once so many various and correspondent\\nimages. The reader will easily extend this observation to more\\nobjections of the same kind.\\n\\n\\nIf there are others which seem rather to charge him with a defect or\\nnarrowness of genius, than an excess of it, those seeming defects will\\nbe found upon examination to proceed wholly from the nature of the\\ntimes he lived in. Such are his grosser representations of the gods;\\nand the vicious and imperfect manners of his heroes; but I must here\\nspeak a word of the latter, as it is a point generally carried into\\nextremes, both by the censurers and defenders of Homer. It must be a\\nstrange partiality to antiquity, to think with Madame Dacier,[38] “that\\nthose times and manners are so much the more excellent, as they are\\nmore contrary to ours.” Who can be so prejudiced in their favour as to\\nmagnify the felicity of those ages, when a spirit of revenge and\\ncruelty, joined with the practice of rapine and robbery, reigned\\nthrough the world: when no mercy was shown but for the sake of lucre;\\nwhen the greatest princes were put to the sword, and their wives and\\ndaughters made slaves and concubines? On the other side, I would not be\\nso delicate as those modern critics, who are shocked at the servile\\noffices and mean employments in which we sometimes see the heroes of\\nHomer engaged. There is a pleasure in taking a view of that simplicity,\\nin opposition to the luxury of succeeding ages: in beholding monarchs\\nwithout their guards; princes tending their flocks, and princesses\\ndrawing water from the springs. When we read Homer, we ought to reflect\\nthat we are reading the most ancient author in the heathen world; and\\nthose who consider him in this light, will double their pleasure in the\\nperusal of him. Let them think they are growing acquainted with nations\\nand people that are now no more; that they are stepping almost three\\nthousand years back into the remotest antiquity, and entertaining\\nthemselves with a clear and surprising vision of things nowhere else to\\nbe found, the only true mirror of that ancient world. By this means\\nalone their greatest obstacles will vanish; and what usually creates\\ntheir dislike, will become a satisfaction.\\n\\nThis consideration may further serve to answer for the constant use of\\nthe same epithets to his gods and heroes; such as the “far-darting\\nPhœbus,” the “blue-eyed Pallas,” the “swift-footed Achilles,” &c.,\\nwhich some have censured as impertinent, and tediously repeated. Those\\nof the gods depended upon the powers and offices then believed to\\nbelong to them; and had contracted a weight and veneration from the\\nrites and solemn devotions in which they were used: they were a sort of\\nattributes with which it was a matter of religion to salute them on all\\noccasions, and which it was an irreverence to omit. As for the epithets\\nof great men, Mons. Boileau is of opinion, that they were in the nature\\nof surnames, and repeated as such; for the Greeks having no names\\nderived from their fathers, were obliged to add some other distinction\\nof each person; either naming his parents expressly, or his place of\\nbirth, profession, or the like: as Alexander the son of Philip,\\nHerodotus of Halicarnassus, Diogenes the Cynic, &c. Homer, therefore,\\ncomplying with the custom of his country, used such distinctive\\nadditions as better agreed with poetry. And, indeed, we have something\\nparallel to these in modern times, such as the names of Harold\\nHarefoot, Edmund Ironside, Edward Longshanks, Edward the Black Prince,\\n&c. If yet this be thought to account better for the propriety than for\\nthe repetition, I shall add a further conjecture. Hesiod, dividing the\\nworld into its different ages, has placed a fourth age, between the\\nbrazen and the iron one, of “heroes distinct from other men; a divine\\nrace who fought at Thebes and Troy, are called demi-gods, and live by\\nthe care of Jupiter in the islands of the blessed.”[39] Now among the\\ndivine honours which were paid them, they might have this also in\\ncommon with the gods, not to be mentioned without the solemnity of an\\nepithet, and such as might be acceptable to them by celebrating their\\nfamilies, actions or qualities.\\n\\nWhat other cavils have been raised against Homer, are such as hardly\\ndeserve a reply, but will yet be taken notice of as they occur in the\\ncourse of the work. Many have been occasioned by an injudicious\\nendeavour to exalt Virgil; which is much the same, as if one should\\nthink to raise the superstructure by undermining the foundation: one\\nwould imagine, by the whole course of their parallels, that these\\ncritics never so much as heard of Homer’s having written first; a\\nconsideration which whoever compares these two poets ought to have\\nalways in his eye. Some accuse him for the same things which they\\noverlook or praise in the other; as when they prefer the fable and\\nmoral of the Æneis to those of the Iliad, for the same reasons which\\nmight set the Odyssey above the Æneis; as that the hero is a wiser man,\\nand the action of the one more beneficial to his country than that of\\nthe other; or else they blame him for not doing what he never designed;\\nas because Achilles is not as good and perfect a prince as Æneas, when\\nthe very moral of his poem required a contrary character: it is thus\\nthat Rapin judges in his comparison of Homer and Virgil. Others select\\nthose particular passages of Homer which are not so laboured as some\\nthat Virgil drew out of them: this is the whole management of Scaliger\\nin his Poetics. Others quarrel with what they take for low and mean\\nexpressions, sometimes through a false delicacy and refinement, oftener\\nfrom an ignorance of the graces of the original, and then triumph in\\nthe awkwardness of their own translations: this is the conduct of\\nPerrault in his Parallels. Lastly, there are others, who, pretending to\\na fairer proceeding, distinguish between the personal merit of Homer,\\nand that of his work; but when they come to assign the causes of the\\ngreat reputation of the Iliad, they found it upon the ignorance of his\\ntimes, and the prejudice of those that followed; and in pursuance of\\nthis principle, they make those accidents (such as the contention of\\nthe cities, &c.) to be the causes of his fame, which were in reality\\nthe consequences of his merit. The same might as well be said of\\nVirgil, or any great author whose general character will infallibly\\nraise many casual additions to their reputation. This is the method of\\nMons. de la Mott; who yet confesses upon the whole that in whatever age\\nHomer had lived, he must have been the greatest poet of his nation, and\\nthat he may be said in his sense to be the master even of those who\\nsurpassed him.\\n\\nIn all these objections we see nothing that contradicts his title to\\nthe honour of the chief invention: and as long as this (which is indeed\\nthe characteristic of poetry itself) remains unequalled by his\\nfollowers, he still continues superior to them. A cooler judgment may\\ncommit fewer faults, and be more approved in the eyes of one sort of\\ncritics: but that warmth of fancy will carry the loudest and most\\nuniversal applauses which holds the heart of a reader under the\\nstrongest enchantment. Homer not only appears the inventor of poetry,\\nbut excels all the inventors of other arts, in this, that he has\\nswallowed up the honour of those who succeeded him. What he has done\\nadmitted no increase, it only left room for contraction or regulation.\\nHe showed all the stretch of fancy at once; and if he has failed in\\nsome of his flights, it was but because he attempted everything. A work\\nof this kind seems like a mighty tree, which rises from the most\\nvigorous seed, is improved with industry, flourishes, and produces the\\nfinest fruit: nature and art conspire to raise it; pleasure and profit\\njoin to make it valuable: and they who find the justest faults, have\\nonly said that a few branches which run luxuriant through a richness of\\nnature, might be lopped into form to give it a more regular appearance.\\n\\nHaving now spoken of the beauties and defects of the original, it\\nremains to treat of the translation, with the same view to the chief\\ncharacteristic. As far as that is seen in the main parts of the poem,\\nsuch as the fable, manners, and sentiments, no translator can prejudice\\nit but by wilful omissions or contractions. As it also breaks out in\\nevery particular image, description, and simile, whoever lessens or too\\nmuch softens those, takes off from this chief character. It is the\\nfirst grand duty of an interpreter to give his author entire and\\nunmaimed; and for the rest, the diction and versification only are his\\nproper province, since these must be his own, but the others he is to\\ntake as he finds them.\\n\\nIt should then be considered what methods may afford some equivalent in\\nour language for the graces of these in the Greek. It is certain no\\nliteral translation can be just to an excellent original in a superior\\nlanguage: but it is a great mistake to imagine (as many have done) that\\na rash paraphrase can make amends for this general defect; which is no\\nless in danger to lose the spirit of an ancient, by deviating into the\\nmodern manners of expression. If there be sometimes a darkness, there\\nis often a light in antiquity, which nothing better preserves than a\\nversion almost literal. I know no liberties one ought to take, but\\nthose which are necessary to transfusing the spirit of the original,\\nand supporting the poetical style of the translation: and I will\\nventure to say, there have not been more men misled in former times by\\na servile, dull adherence to the letter, than have been deluded in ours\\nby a chimerical, insolent hope of raising and improving their author.\\nIt is not to be doubted, that the fire of the poem is what a translator\\nshould principally regard, as it is most likely to expire in his\\nmanaging: however, it is his safest way to be content with preserving\\nthis to his utmost in the whole, without endeavouring to be more than\\nhe finds his author is, in any particular place. It is a great secret\\nin writing, to know when to be plain, and when poetical and figurative;\\nand it is what Homer will teach us, if we will but follow modestly in\\nhis footsteps. Where his diction is bold and lofty, let us raise ours\\nas high as we can; but where his is plain and humble, we ought not to\\nbe deterred from imitating him by the fear of incurring the censure of\\na mere English critic. Nothing that belongs to Homer seems to have been\\nmore commonly mistaken than the just pitch of his style: some of his\\ntranslators having swelled into fustian in a proud confidence of the\\nsublime; others sunk into flatness, in a cold and timorous notion of\\nsimplicity. Methinks I see these different followers of Homer, some\\nsweating and straining after him by violent leaps and bounds (the\\ncertain signs of false mettle), others slowly and servilely creeping in\\nhis train, while the poet himself is all the time proceeding with an\\nunaffected and equal majesty before them. However, of the two extremes\\none could sooner pardon frenzy than frigidity; no author is to be\\nenvied for such commendations, as he may gain by that character of\\nstyle, which his friends must agree together to call simplicity, and\\nthe rest of the world will call dulness. There is a graceful and\\ndignified simplicity, as well as a bold and sordid one; which differ as\\nmuch from each other as the air of a plain man from that of a sloven:\\nit is one thing to be tricked up, and another not to be dressed at all.\\nSimplicity is the mean between ostentation and rusticity.\\n\\nThis pure and noble simplicity is nowhere in such perfection as in the\\nScripture and our author. One may affirm, with all respect to the\\ninspired writings, that the Divine Spirit made use of no other words\\nbut what were intelligible and common to men at that time, and in that\\npart of the world; and, as Homer is the author nearest to those, his\\nstyle must of course bear a greater resemblance to the sacred books\\nthan that of any other writer. This consideration (together with what\\nhas been observed of the parity of some of his thoughts) may, methinks,\\ninduce a translator, on the one hand, to give in to several of those\\ngeneral phrases and manners of expression, which have attained a\\nveneration even in our language from being used in the Old Testament;\\nas, on the other, to avoid those which have been appropriated to the\\nDivinity, and in a manner consigned to mystery and religion.\\n\\nFor a further preservation of this air of simplicity, a particular care\\nshould be taken to express with all plainness those moral sentences and\\nproverbial speeches which are so numerous in this poet. They have\\nsomething venerable, and as I may say, oracular, in that unadorned\\ngravity and shortness with which they are delivered: a grace which\\nwould be utterly lost by endeavouring to give them what we call a more\\ningenious (that is, a more modern) turn in the paraphrase.\\n\\nPerhaps the mixture of some Græcisms and old words after the manner of\\nMilton, if done without too much affectation, might not have an ill\\neffect in a version of this particular work, which most of any other\\nseems to require a venerable, antique cast. But certainly the use of\\nmodern terms of war and government, such as “platoon, campaign, junto,”\\nor the like, (into which some of his translators have fallen) cannot be\\nallowable; those only excepted without which it is impossible to treat\\nthe subjects in any living language.\\n\\nThere are two peculiarities in Homer’s diction, which are a sort of\\nmarks or moles by which every common eye distinguishes him at first\\nsight; those who are not his greatest admirers look upon them as\\ndefects, and those who are, seemed pleased with them as beauties. I\\nspeak of his compound epithets, and of his repetitions. Many of the\\nformer cannot be done literally into English without destroying the\\npurity of our language. I believe such should be retained as slide\\neasily of themselves into an English compound, without violence to the\\near or to the received rules of composition, as well as those which\\nhave received a sanction from the authority of our best poets, and are\\nbecome familiar through their use of them; such as “the\\ncloud-compelling Jove,” &c. As for the rest, whenever any can be as\\nfully and significantly expressed in a single word as in a compounded\\none, the course to be taken is obvious.\\n\\nSome that cannot be so turned, as to preserve their full image by one\\nor two words, may have justice done them by circumlocution; as the\\nepithet einosiphyllos to a mountain, would appear little or ridiculous\\ntranslated literally “leaf-shaking,” but affords a majestic idea in the\\nperiphrasis: “the lofty mountain shakes his waving woods.” Others that\\nadmit of different significations, may receive an advantage from a\\njudicious variation, according to the occasions on which they are\\nintroduced. For example, the epithet of Apollo, ἑκηβόλος or\\n“far-shooting,” is capable of two explications; one literal, in respect\\nof the darts and bow, the ensigns of that god; the other allegorical,\\nwith regard to the rays of the sun; therefore, in such places where\\nApollo is represented as a god in person, I would use the former\\ninterpretation; and where the effects of the sun are described, I would\\nmake choice of the latter. Upon the whole, it will be necessary to\\navoid that perpetual repetition of the same epithets which we find in\\nHomer, and which, though it might be accommodated (as has been already\\nshown) to the ear of those times, is by no means so to ours: but one\\nmay wait for opportunities of placing them, where they derive an\\nadditional beauty from the occasions on which they are employed; and in\\ndoing this properly, a translator may at once show his fancy and his\\njudgment.\\n\\nAs for Homer’s repetitions, we may divide them into three sorts: of\\nwhole narrations and speeches, of single sentences, and of one verse or\\nhemistitch. I hope it is not impossible to have such a regard to these,\\nas neither to lose so known a mark of the author on the one hand, nor\\nto offend the reader too much on the other. The repetition is not\\nungraceful in those speeches, where the dignity of the speaker renders\\nit a sort of insolence to alter his words; as in the messages from gods\\nto men, or from higher powers to inferiors in concerns of state, or\\nwhere the ceremonial of religion seems to require it, in the solemn\\nforms of prayers, oaths, or the like. In other cases, I believe the\\nbest rule is, to be guided by the nearness, or distance, at which the\\nrepetitions are placed in the original: when they follow too close, one\\nmay vary the expression; but it is a question, whether a professed\\ntranslator be authorized to omit any: if they be tedious, the author is\\nto answer for it.\\n\\nIt only remains to speak of the versification. Homer (as has been said)\\nis perpetually applying the sound to the sense, and varying it on every\\nnew subject. This is indeed one of the most exquisite beauties of\\npoetry, and attainable by very few: I only know of Homer eminent for it\\nin the Greek, and Virgil in the Latin. I am sensible it is what may\\nsometimes happen by chance, when a writer is warm, and fully possessed\\nof his image: however, it may reasonably be believed they designed\\nthis, in whose verse it so manifestly appears in a superior degree to\\nall others. Few readers have the ear to be judges of it: but those who\\nhave, will see I have endeavoured at this beauty.\\n\\nUpon the whole, I must confess myself utterly incapable of doing\\njustice to Homer. I attempt him in no other hope but that which one may\\nentertain without much vanity, of giving a more tolerable copy of him\\nthan any entire translation in verse has yet done. We have only those\\nof Chapman, Hobbes, and Ogilby. Chapman has taken the advantage of an\\nimmeasurable length of verse, notwithstanding which, there is scarce\\nany paraphrase more loose and rambling than his. He has frequent\\ninterpolations of four or six lines; and I remember one in the\\nthirteenth book of the Odyssey, ver. 312, where he has spun twenty\\nverses out of two. He is often mistaken in so bold a manner, that one\\nmight think he deviated on purpose, if he did not in other places of\\nhis notes insist so much upon verbal trifles. He appears to have had a\\nstrong affectation of extracting new meanings out of his author;\\ninsomuch as to promise, in his rhyming preface, a poem of the mysteries\\nhe had revealed in Homer; and perhaps he endeavoured to strain the\\nobvious sense to this end. His expression is involved in fustian; a\\nfault for which he was remarkable in his original writings, as in the\\ntragedy of Bussy d’Amboise, &c. In a word, the nature of the man may\\naccount for his whole performance; for he appears, from his preface and\\nremarks, to have been of an arrogant turn, and an enthusiast in poetry.\\nHis own boast, of having finished half the Iliad in less than fifteen\\nweeks, shows with what negligence his version was performed. But that\\nwhich is to be allowed him, and which very much contributed to cover\\nhis defects, is a daring fiery spirit that animates his translation,\\nwhich is something like what one might imagine Homer himself would have\\nwrit before he arrived at years of discretion.\\n\\nHobbes has given us a correct explanation of the sense in general; but\\nfor particulars and circumstances he continually lops them, and often\\nomits the most beautiful. As for its being esteemed a close\\ntranslation, I doubt not many have been led into that error by the\\nshortness of it, which proceeds not from his following the original\\nline by line, but from the contractions above mentioned. He sometimes\\nomits whole similes and sentences; and is now and then guilty of\\nmistakes, into which no writer of his learning could have fallen, but\\nthrough carelessness. His poetry, as well as Ogilby’s, is too mean for\\ncriticism.\\n\\nIt is a great loss to the poetical world that Mr. Dryden did not live\\nto translate the Iliad. He has left us only the first book, and a small\\npart of the sixth; in which if he has in some places not truly\\ninterpreted the sense, or preserved the antiquities, it ought to be\\nexcused on account of the haste he was obliged to write in. He seems to\\nhave had too much regard to Chapman, whose words he sometimes copies,\\nand has unhappily followed him in passages where he wanders from the\\noriginal. However, had he translated the whole work, I would no more\\nhave attempted Homer after him than Virgil: his version of whom\\n(notwithstanding some human errors) is the most noble and spirited\\ntranslation I know in any language. But the fate of great geniuses is\\nlike that of great ministers: though they are confessedly the first in\\nthe commonwealth of letters, they must be envied and calumniated only\\nfor being at the head of it.\\n\\nThat which, in my opinion, ought to be the endeavour of any one who\\ntranslates Homer, is above all things to keep alive that spirit and\\nfire which makes his chief character: in particular places, where the\\nsense can bear any doubt, to follow the strongest and most poetical, as\\nmost agreeing with that character; to copy him in all the variations of\\nhis style, and the different modulations of his numbers; to preserve,\\nin the more active or descriptive parts, a warmth and elevation; in the\\nmore sedate or narrative, a plainness and solemnity; in the speeches, a\\nfulness and perspicuity; in the sentences, a shortness and gravity; not\\nto neglect even the little figures and turns on the words, nor\\nsometimes the very cast of the periods; neither to omit nor confound\\nany rites or customs of antiquity: perhaps too he ought to include the\\nwhole in a shorter compass than has hitherto been done by any\\ntranslator who has tolerably preserved either the sense or poetry. What\\nI would further recommend to him is, to study his author rather from\\nhis own text, than from any commentaries, how learned soever, or\\nwhatever figure they may make in the estimation of the world; to\\nconsider him attentively in comparison with Virgil above all the\\nancients, and with Milton above all the moderns. Next these, the\\nArchbishop of Cambray’s Telemachus may give him the truest idea of the\\nspirit and turn of our author; and Bossu’s admirable Treatise of the\\nEpic Poem the justest notion of his design and conduct. But after all,\\nwith whatever judgment and study a man may proceed, or with whatever\\nhappiness he may perform such a work, he must hope to please but a few;\\nthose only who have at once a taste of poetry, and competent learning.\\nFor to satisfy such a want either, is not in the nature of this\\nundertaking; since a mere modern wit can like nothing that is not\\nmodern, and a pedant nothing that is not Greek.\\n\\nWhat I have done is submitted to the public; from whose opinions I am\\nprepared to learn; though I fear no judges so little as our best poets,\\nwho are most sensible of the weight of this task. As for the worst,\\nwhatever they shall please to say, they may give me some concern as\\nthey are unhappy men, but none as they are malignant writers. I was\\nguided in this translation by judgments very different from theirs, and\\nby persons for whom they can have no kindness, if an old observation be\\ntrue, that the strongest antipathy in the world is that of fools to men\\nof wit. Mr. Addison was the first whose advice determined me to\\nundertake this task; who was pleased to write to me upon that occasion\\nin such terms as I cannot repeat without vanity. I was obliged to Sir\\nRichard Steele for a very early recommendation of my undertaking to the\\npublic. Dr. Swift promoted my interest with that warmth with which he\\nalways serves his friend. The humanity and frankness of Sir Samuel\\nGarth are what I never knew wanting on any occasion. I must also\\nacknowledge, with infinite pleasure, the many friendly offices, as well\\nas sincere criticisms, of Mr. Congreve, who had led me the way in\\ntranslating some parts of Homer. I must add the names of Mr. Rowe, and\\nDr. Parnell, though I shall take a further opportunity of doing justice\\nto the last, whose good nature (to give it a great panegyric), is no\\nless extensive than his learning. The favour of these gentlemen is not\\nentirely undeserved by one who bears them so true an affection. But\\nwhat can I say of the honour so many of the great have done me; while\\nthe first names of the age appear as my subscribers, and the most\\ndistinguished patrons and ornaments of learning as my chief\\nencouragers? Among these it is a particular pleasure to me to find,\\nthat my highest obligations are to such who have done most honour to\\nthe name of poet: that his grace the Duke of Buckingham was not\\ndispleased I should undertake the author to whom he has given (in his\\nexcellent Essay), so complete a praise:\\n\\n“Read Homer once, and you can read no more;\\nFor all books else appear so mean, so poor,\\nVerse will seem prose: but still persist to read,\\nAnd Homer will be all the books you need.”\\n\\n\\nThat the Earl of Halifax was one of the first to favour me; of whom it\\nis hard to say whether the advancement of the polite arts is more owing\\nto his generosity or his example: that such a genius as my Lord\\nBolingbroke, not more distinguished in the great scenes of business,\\nthan in all the useful and entertaining parts of learning, has not\\nrefused to be the critic of these sheets, and the patron of their\\nwriter: and that the noble author of the tragedy of “Heroic Love” has\\ncontinued his partiality to me, from my writing pastorals to my\\nattempting the Iliad. I cannot deny myself the pride of confessing,\\nthat I have had the advantage not only of their advice for the conduct\\nin general, but their correction of several particulars of this\\ntranslation.\\n\\nI could say a great deal of the pleasure of being distinguished by the\\nEarl of Carnarvon; but it is almost absurd to particularize any one\\ngenerous action in a person whose whole life is a continued series of\\nthem. Mr. Stanhope, the present secretary of state, will pardon my\\ndesire of having it known that he was pleased to promote this affair.\\nThe particular zeal of Mr. Harcourt (the son of the late Lord\\nChancellor) gave me a proof how much I am honoured in a share of his\\nfriendship. I must attribute to the same motive that of several others\\nof my friends: to whom all acknowledgments are rendered unnecessary by\\nthe privileges of a familiar correspondence; and I am satisfied I can\\nno way better oblige men of their turn than by my silence.\\n\\nIn short, I have found more patrons than ever Homer wanted. He would\\nhave thought himself happy to have met the same favour at Athens that\\nhas been shown me by its learned rival, the University of Oxford. And I\\ncan hardly envy him those pompous honours he received after death, when\\nI reflect on the enjoyment of so many agreeable obligations, and easy\\nfriendships, which make the satisfaction of life. This distinction is\\nthe more to be acknowledged, as it is shown to one whose pen has never\\ngratified the prejudices of particular parties, or the vanities of\\nparticular men. Whatever the success may prove, I shall never repent of\\nan undertaking in which I have experienced the candour and friendship\\nof so many persons of merit; and in which I hope to pass some of those\\nyears of youth that are generally lost in a circle of follies, after a\\nmanner neither wholly unuseful to others, nor disagreeable to myself.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE ILIAD.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBOOK I.\\n\\n\\nARGUMENT.[40]\\n\\n\\nTHE CONTENTION OF ACHILLES AND AGAMEMNON.\\n\\n\\nIn the war of Troy, the Greeks having sacked some of the neighbouring\\ntowns, and taken from thence two beautiful captives, Chryseïs and\\nBriseïs, allotted the first to Agamemnon, and the last to Achilles.\\nChryses, the father of Chryseïs, and priest of Apollo, comes to the\\nGrecian camp to ransom her; with which the action of the poem opens, in\\nthe tenth year of the siege. The priest being refused, and insolently\\ndismissed by Agamemnon, entreats for vengeance from his god; who\\ninflicts a pestilence on the Greeks. Achilles calls a council, and\\nencourages Chalcas to declare the cause of it; who attributes it to the\\nrefusal of Chryseïs. The king, being obliged to send back his captive,\\nenters into a furious contest with Achilles, which Nestor pacifies;\\nhowever, as he had the absolute command of the army, he seizes on\\nBriseïs in revenge.

Iris is sent to call Helen to behold the\\nfight. She leads her to the walls of Troy, where Priam sat with his\\ncounsellers observing the Grecian leaders on the plain below, to whom\\nHelen gives an account of the chief of them. The kings on either part\\ntake the solemn oath for the conditions of the combat. The duel ensues;\\nwherein Paris being overcome, he is snatched away in a cloud by Venus,\\nand transported to his apartment. She then calls Helen from the walls,\\nand brings the lovers together. Agamemnon, on the part of the Grecians,\\ndemands the restoration of Helen, and the performance of the articles.\\n    The three-and-twentieth day still continues throughout this book.\\n    The scene is sometimes in the fields before Troy, and sometimes in\\n    Troy itself.\\n\\n\\nThus by their leaders’ care each martial band\\nMoves into ranks, and stretches o’er the land.\\nWith shouts the Trojans, rushing from afar,\\nProclaim their motions, and provoke the war.\\nSo when inclement winters vex the plain\\nWith piercing frosts, or thick-descending rain,\\nTo warmer seas the cranes embodied fly,[108]\\nWith noise, and order, through the midway sky;\\nTo pigmy nations wounds and death they bring,\\nAnd all the war descends upon the wing,\\nBut silent, breathing rage, resolved and skill’d[109]\\nBy mutual aids to fix a doubtful field,\\nSwift march the Greeks: the rapid dust around\\nDarkening arises from the labour’d ground.\\nThus from his flaggy wings when Notus sheds\\nA night of vapours round the mountain heads,\\nSwift-gliding mists the dusky fields invade,\\nTo thieves more grateful than the midnight shade;\\nWhile scarce the swains their feeding flocks survey,\\nLost and confused amidst the thicken’d day:\\nSo wrapp’d in gathering dust, the Grecian train,\\nA moving cloud, swept on, and hid the plain.\\n\\nNow front to front the hostile armies stand,\\nEager of fight, and only wait command;\\nWhen, to the van, before the sons of fame\\nWhom Troy sent forth, the beauteous Paris came:\\nIn form a god! the panther’s speckled hide\\nFlow’d o’er his armour with an easy pride:\\nHis bended bow across his shoulders flung,\\nHis sword beside him negligently hung;\\nTwo pointed spears he shook with gallant grace,\\nAnd dared the bravest of the Grecian race.\\n\\nAs thus, with glorious air and proud disdain,\\nHe boldly stalk’d, the foremost on the plain,\\nHim Menelaus, loved of Mars, espies,\\nWith heart elated, and with joyful eyes:\\nSo joys a lion, if the branching deer,\\nOr mountain goat, his bulky prize, appear;\\nEager he seizes and devours the slain,\\nPress’d by bold youths and baying dogs in vain.\\nThus fond of vengeance, with a furious bound,\\nIn clanging arms he leaps upon the ground\\nFrom his high chariot: him, approaching near,\\nThe beauteous champion views with marks of fear,\\nSmit with a conscious sense, retires behind,\\nAnd shuns the fate he well deserved to find.\\nAs when some shepherd, from the rustling trees[110]\\nShot forth to view, a scaly serpent sees,\\nTrembling and pale, he starts with wild affright\\nAnd all confused precipitates his flight:\\nSo from the king the shining warrior flies,\\nAnd plunged amid the thickest Trojans lies.\\n\\nAs godlike Hector sees the prince retreat,\\nHe thus upbraids him with a generous heat:\\n“Unhappy Paris![111] but to women brave!\\nSo fairly form’d, and only to deceive!\\nOh, hadst thou died when first thou saw’st the light,\\nOr died at least before thy nuptial rite!\\nA better fate than vainly thus to boast,\\nAnd fly, the scandal of thy Trojan host.\\nGods! how the scornful Greeks exult to see\\nTheir fears of danger undeceived in thee!\\nThy figure promised with a martial air,\\nBut ill thy soul supplies a form so fair.\\nIn former days, in all thy gallant pride,\\nWhen thy tall ships triumphant stemm’d the tide,\\nWhen Greece beheld thy painted canvas flow,\\nAnd crowds stood wondering at the passing show,\\nSay, was it thus, with such a baffled mien,\\nYou met the approaches of the Spartan queen,\\nThus from her realm convey’d the beauteous prize,\\nAnd both her warlike lords outshined in Helen’s eyes?\\nThis deed, thy foes’ delight, thy own disgrace,\\nThy father’s grief, and ruin of thy race;\\nThis deed recalls thee to the proffer’d fight;\\nOr hast thou injured whom thou dar’st not right?\\nSoon to thy cost the field would make thee know\\nThou keep’st the consort of a braver foe.\\nThy graceful form instilling soft desire,\\nThy curling tresses, and thy silver lyre,\\nBeauty and youth; in vain to these you trust,\\nWhen youth and beauty shall be laid in dust:\\nTroy yet may wake, and one avenging blow\\nCrush the dire author of his country’s woe.”\\n\\nHis silence here, with blushes, Paris breaks:\\n“’Tis just, my brother, what your anger speaks:\\nBut who like thee can boast a soul sedate,\\nSo firmly proof to all the shocks of fate?\\nThy force, like steel, a temper’d hardness shows,\\nStill edged to wound, and still untired with blows,\\nLike steel, uplifted by some strenuous swain,\\nWith falling woods to strew the wasted plain.\\nThy gifts I praise; nor thou despise the charms\\nWith which a lover golden Venus arms;\\nSoft moving speech, and pleasing outward show,\\nNo wish can gain them, but the gods bestow.\\nYet, would’st thou have the proffer’d combat stand,\\nThe Greeks and Trojans seat on either hand;\\nThen let a midway space our hosts divide,\\nAnd, on that stage of war, the cause be tried:\\nBy Paris there the Spartan king be fought,\\nFor beauteous Helen and the wealth she brought;\\nAnd who his rival can in arms subdue,\\nHis be the fair, and his the treasure too.\\nThus with a lasting league your toils may cease,\\nAnd Troy possess her fertile fields in peace;\\nThus may the Greeks review their native shore,\\nMuch famed for generous steeds, for beauty more.”\\n\\nHe said. The challenge Hector heard with joy,\\nThen with his spear restrain’d the youth of Troy,\\nHeld by the midst, athwart; and near the foe\\nAdvanced with steps majestically slow:\\nWhile round his dauntless head the Grecians pour\\nTheir stones and arrows in a mingled shower.\\n\\nThen thus the monarch, great Atrides, cried:\\n“Forbear, ye warriors! lay the darts aside:\\nA parley Hector asks, a message bears;\\nWe know him by the various plume he wears.”\\nAwed by his high command the Greeks attend,\\nThe tumult silence, and the fight suspend.\\n\\nWhile from the centre Hector rolls his eyes\\nOn either host, and thus to both applies:\\n“Hear, all ye Trojan, all ye Grecian bands,\\nWhat Paris, author of the war, demands.\\nYour shining swords within the sheath restrain,\\nAnd pitch your lances in the yielding plain.\\nHere in the midst, in either army’s sight,\\nHe dares the Spartan king to single fight;\\nAnd wills that Helen and the ravish’d spoil,\\nThat caused the contest, shall reward the toil.\\nLet these the brave triumphant victor grace,\\nAnd different nations part in leagues of peace.”\\n\\nHe spoke: in still suspense on either side\\nEach army stood: the Spartan chief replied:\\n\\n“Me too, ye warriors, hear, whose fatal right\\nA world engages in the toils of fight.\\nTo me the labour of the field resign;\\nMe Paris injured; all the war be mine.\\nFall he that must, beneath his rival’s arms;\\nAnd live the rest, secure of future harms.\\nTwo lambs, devoted by your country’s rite,\\nTo earth a sable, to the sun a white,\\nPrepare, ye Trojans!

what majestic mien!\\nShe moves a goddess, and she looks a queen!\\nYet hence, O Heaven, convey that fatal face,\\nAnd from destruction save the Trojan race.”\\n\\nThe good old Priam welcomed her, and cried,\\n“Approach, my child, and grace thy father’s side.\\nSee on the plain thy Grecian spouse appears,\\nThe friends and kindred of thy former years.\\nNo crime of thine our present sufferings draws,\\nNot thou, but Heaven’s disposing will, the cause\\nThe gods these armies and this force employ,\\nThe hostile gods conspire the fate of Troy.\\nBut lift thy eyes, and say, what Greek is he\\n(Far as from hence these aged orbs can see)\\nAround whose brow such martial graces shine,\\nSo tall, so awful, and almost divine!\\nThough some of larger stature tread the green,\\nNone match his grandeur and exalted mien:\\nHe seems a monarch, and his country’s pride.”\\nThus ceased the king, and thus the fair replied:\\n\\n“Before thy presence, father, I appear,\\nWith conscious shame and reverential fear.\\nAh! had I died, ere to these walls I fled,\\nFalse to my country, and my nuptial bed;\\nMy brothers, friends, and daughter left behind,\\nFalse to them all, to Paris only kind!\\nFor this I mourn, till grief or dire disease\\nShall waste the form whose fault it was to please!\\nThe king of kings, Atrides, you survey,\\nGreat in the war, and great in arts of sway:\\nMy brother once, before my days of shame!\\nAnd oh! that still he bore a brother’s name!”\\n\\nWith wonder Priam view’d the godlike man,\\nExtoll’d the happy prince, and thus began:\\n“O bless’d Atrides! born to prosperous fate,\\nSuccessful monarch of a mighty state!\\nHow vast thy empire! Of your matchless train\\nWhat numbers lost, what numbers yet remain!\\nIn Phrygia once were gallant armies known,\\nIn ancient time, when Otreus fill’d the throne,\\nWhen godlike Mygdon led their troops of horse,\\nAnd I, to join them, raised the Trojan force:\\nAgainst the manlike Amazons we stood,[114]\\nAnd Sangar’s stream ran purple with their blood.\\nBut far inferior those, in martial grace,\\nAnd strength of numbers, to this Grecian race.”\\n\\nThis said, once more he view’d the warrior train;\\n“What’s he, whose arms lie scatter’d on the plain?\\nBroad is his breast, his shoulders larger spread,\\nThough great Atrides overtops his head.\\nNor yet appear his care and conduct small;\\nFrom rank to rank he moves, and orders all.\\nThe stately ram thus measures o’er the ground,\\nAnd, master of the flock, surveys them round.”\\n\\nThen Helen thus: “Whom your discerning eyes\\nHave singled out, is Ithacus the wise;\\nA barren island boasts his glorious birth;\\nHis fame for wisdom fills the spacious earth.”\\n\\nAntenor took the word, and thus began:[115]\\n“Myself, O king! have seen that wondrous man\\nWhen, trusting Jove and hospitable laws,\\nTo Troy he came, to plead the Grecian cause;\\n(Great Menelaus urged the same request;)\\nMy house was honour’d with each royal guest:\\nI knew their persons, and admired their parts,\\nBoth brave in arms, and both approved in arts.\\nErect, the Spartan most engaged our view;\\nUlysses seated, greater reverence drew.\\nWhen Atreus’ son harangued the listening train,\\nJust was his sense, and his expression plain,\\nHis words succinct, yet full, without a fault;\\nHe spoke no more than just the thing he ought.\\nBut when Ulysses rose, in thought profound,[116]\\nHis modest eyes he fix’d upon the ground;\\nAs one unskill’d or dumb, he seem’d to stand,\\nNor raised his head, nor stretch’d his sceptred hand;\\nBut, when he speaks, what elocution flows!\\nSoft as the fleeces of descending snows,[117]\\nThe copious accents fall, with easy art;\\nMelting they fall, and sink into the heart!\\nWondering we hear, and fix’d in deep surprise,\\nOur ears refute the censure of our eyes.”\\n\\nThe king then ask’d (as yet the camp he view’d)\\n“What chief is that, with giant strength endued,\\nWhose brawny shoulders, and whose swelling chest,\\nAnd lofty stature, far exceed the rest?\\n“Ajax the great, (the beauteous queen replied,)\\nHimself a host: the Grecian strength and pride.\\nSee! bold Idomeneus superior towers\\nAmid yon circle of his Cretan powers,\\nGreat as a god! I saw him once before,\\nWith Menelaus on the Spartan shore.\\nThe rest I know, and could in order name;\\nAll valiant chiefs, and men of mighty fame.\\nYet two are wanting of the numerous train,\\nWhom long my eyes have sought, but sought in vain:\\nCastor and Pollux, first in martial force,\\nOne bold on foot, and one renown’d for horse.\\nMy brothers these; the same our native shore,\\nOne house contain’d us, as one mother bore.\\nPerhaps the chiefs, from warlike toils at ease,\\nFor distant Troy refused to sail the seas;\\nPerhaps their swords some nobler quarrel draws,\\nAshamed to combat in their sister’s cause.”\\n\\nSo spoke the fair, nor knew her brothers’ doom;[118]\\nWrapt in the cold embraces of the tomb;\\nAdorn’d with honours in their native shore,\\nSilent they slept, and heard of wars no more.\\n\\nMeantime the heralds, through the crowded town,\\nBring the rich wine and destined victims down.\\nIdæus’ arms the golden goblets press’d,[119]\\nWho thus the venerable king address’d:\\n“Arise, O father of the Trojan state!\\nThe nations call, thy joyful people wait\\nTo seal the truce, and end the dire debate.\\nParis, thy son, and Sparta’s king advance,\\nIn measured lists to toss the weighty lance;\\nAnd who his rival shall in arms subdue,\\nHis be the dame, and his the treasure too.\\nThus with a lasting league our toils may cease,\\nAnd Troy possess her fertile fields in peace:\\nSo shall the Greeks review their native shore,\\nMuch famed for generous steeds, for beauty more.”\\n\\nWith grief he heard, and bade the chiefs prepare\\nTo join his milk-white coursers to the car;\\nHe mounts the seat, Antenor at his side;\\nThe gentle steeds through Scæa’s gates they guide:[120]\\nNext from the car descending on the plain,\\nAmid the Grecian host and Trojan train,\\nSlow they proceed: the sage Ulysses then\\nArose, and with him rose the king of men.\\nOn either side a sacred herald stands,\\nThe wine they mix, and on each monarch’s hands\\nPour the full urn; then draws the Grecian lord\\nHis cutlass sheathed beside his ponderous sword;\\nFrom the sign’d victims crops the curling hair;[121]\\nThe heralds part it, and the princes share;\\nThen loudly thus before the attentive bands\\nHe calls the gods, and spreads his lifted hands:\\n\\n“O first and greatest power! whom all obey,\\nWho high on Ida’s holy mountain sway,\\nEternal Jove! and you bright orb that roll\\nFrom east to west, and view from pole to pole!\\nThou mother Earth! and all ye living floods!\\nInfernal furies, and Tartarean gods,\\nWho rule the dead, and horrid woes prepare\\nFor perjured kings, and all who falsely swear!\\nHear, and be witness.

and hear, ye gods on high!\\nAnd may their blood, who first the league confound,\\nShed like this wine, disdain the thirsty ground;\\nMay all their consorts serve promiscuous lust,\\nAnd all their lust be scatter’d as the dust!”\\nThus either host their imprecations join’d,\\nWhich Jove refused, and mingled with the wind.\\n\\nThe rites now finish’d, reverend Priam rose,\\nAnd thus express’d a heart o’ercharged with woes:\\n“Ye Greeks and Trojans, let the chiefs engage,\\nBut spare the weakness of my feeble age:\\nIn yonder walls that object let me shun,\\nNor view the danger of so dear a son.\\nWhose arms shall conquer and what prince shall fall,\\nHeaven only knows; for heaven disposes all.”\\n\\nThis said, the hoary king no longer stay’d,\\nBut on his car the slaughter’d victims laid:\\nThen seized the reins his gentle steeds to guide,\\nAnd drove to Troy, Antenor at his side.\\n\\nBold Hector and Ulysses now dispose\\nThe lists of combat, and the ground inclose:\\nNext to decide, by sacred lots prepare,\\nWho first shall launch his pointed spear in air.\\nThe people pray with elevated hands,\\nAnd words like these are heard through all the bands:\\n“Immortal Jove, high Heaven’s superior lord,\\nOn lofty Ida’s holy mount adored!\\nWhoe’er involved us in this dire debate,\\nO give that author of the war to fate\\nAnd shades eternal!

Helenus, the\\nchief augur of Troy, commands Hector to return to the city, in order to\\nappoint a solemn procession of the queen and the Trojan matrons to the\\ntemple of Minerva, to entreat her to remove Diomed from the fight. The\\nbattle relaxing during the absence of Hector, Glaucus and Diomed have\\nan interview between the two armies; where, coming to the knowledge, of\\nthe friendship and hospitality passed between their ancestors, they\\nmake exchange of their arms. Hector, having performed the orders of\\nHelenus, prevails upon Paris to return to the battle, and, taking a\\ntender leave of his wife Andromache, hastens again to the field.\\n    The scene is first in the field of battle, between the rivers\\n    Simois and Scamander, and then changes to Troy.\\n\\n\\nNow heaven forsakes the fight: the immortals yield\\nTo human force and human skill the field:\\nDark showers of javelins fly from foes to foes;\\nNow here, now there, the tide of combat flows;\\nWhile Troy’s famed streams, that bound the deathful plain\\nOn either side, run purple to the main.\\n\\nGreat Ajax first to conquest led the way,\\nBroke the thick ranks, and turn’d the doubtful day.\\nThe Thracian Acamas his falchion found,\\nAnd hew’d the enormous giant to the ground;\\nHis thundering arm a deadly stroke impress’d\\nWhere the black horse-hair nodded o’er his crest;\\nFix’d in his front the brazen weapon lies,\\nAnd seals in endless shades his swimming eyes.\\nNext Teuthras’ son distain’d the sands with blood,\\nAxylus, hospitable, rich, and good:\\nIn fair Arisbe’s walls (his native place)[161]\\nHe held his seat! a friend to human race.\\nFast by the road, his ever-open door\\nObliged the wealthy, and relieved the poor.\\nTo stern Tydides now he falls a prey,\\nNo friend to guard him in the dreadful day!\\nBreathless the good man fell, and by his side\\nHis faithful servant, old Calesius died.\\n\\nBy great Euryalus was Dresus slain,\\nAnd next he laid Opheltius on the plain.\\nTwo twins were near, bold, beautiful, and young,\\nFrom a fair naiad and Bucolion sprung:\\n(Laomedon’s white flocks Bucolion fed,\\nThat monarch’s first-born by a foreign bed;\\nIn secret woods he won the naiad’s grace,\\nAnd two fair infants crown’d his strong embrace:)\\nHere dead they lay in all their youthful charms;\\nThe ruthless victor stripp’d their shining arms.\\n\\nAstyalus by Polypœtes fell;\\nUlysses’ spear Pidytes sent to hell;\\nBy Teucer’s shaft brave Aretaon bled,\\nAnd Nestor’s son laid stern Ablerus dead;\\nGreat Agamemnon, leader of the brave,\\nThe mortal wound of rich Elatus gave,\\nWho held in Pedasus his proud abode,[162]\\nAnd till’d the banks where silver Satnio flow’d.\\nMelanthius by Eurypylus was slain;\\nAnd Phylacus from Leitus flies in vain.\\n\\nUnbless’d Adrastus next at mercy lies\\nBeneath the Spartan spear, a living prize.\\nScared with the din and tumult of the fight,\\nHis headlong steeds, precipitate in flight,\\nRush’d on a tamarisk’s strong trunk, and broke\\nThe shatter’d chariot from the crooked yoke;\\nWide o’er the field, resistless as the wind,\\nFor Troy they fly, and leave their lord behind.\\nProne on his face he sinks beside the wheel:\\nAtrides o’er him shakes his vengeful steel;\\nThe fallen chief in suppliant posture press’d\\nThe victor’s knees, and thus his prayer address’d:\\n\\n“O spare my youth, and for the life I owe\\nLarge gifts of price my father shall bestow.\\nWhen fame shall tell, that, not in battle slain,\\nThy hollow ships his captive son detain:\\nRich heaps of brass shall in thy tent be told,[163]\\nAnd steel well-temper’d, and persuasive gold.”\\n\\nHe said: compassion touch’d the hero’s heart\\nHe stood, suspended with the lifted dart:\\nAs pity pleaded for his vanquish’d prize,\\nStern Agamemnon swift to vengeance flies,\\nAnd, furious, thus: “Oh impotent of mind![164]\\nShall these, shall these Atrides’ mercy find?\\nWell hast thou known proud Troy’s perfidious land,\\nAnd well her natives merit at thy hand!\\nNot one of all the race, nor sex, nor age,\\nShall save a Trojan from our boundless rage:\\nIlion shall perish whole, and bury all;\\nHer babes, her infants at the breast, shall fall;[165]\\nA dreadful lesson of exampled fate,\\nTo warn the nations, and to curb the great!”\\n\\nThe monarch spoke; the words, with warmth address’d,\\nTo rigid justice steel’d his brother’s breast.\\nFierce from his knees the hapless chief he thrust;\\nThe monarch’s javelin stretch’d him in the dust,\\nThen pressing with his foot his panting heart,\\nForth from the slain he tugg’d the reeking dart.\\nOld Nestor saw, and roused the warrior’s rage;\\n“Thus, heroes! thus the vigorous combat wage;\\nNo son of Mars descend, for servile gains,\\nTo touch the booty, while a foe remains.\\nBehold yon glittering host, your future spoil!\\nFirst gain the conquest, then reward the toil.”\\n\\nAnd now had Greece eternal fame acquired,\\nAnd frighted Troy within her walls, retired,\\nHad not sage Helenus her state redress’d,\\nTaught by the gods that moved his sacred breast.\\nWhere Hector stood, with great Æneas join’d,\\nThe seer reveal’d the counsels of his mind:\\n\\n“Ye generous chiefs! on whom the immortals lay\\nThe cares and glories of this doubtful day;\\nOn whom your aids, your country’s hopes depend;\\nWise to consult, and active to defend!\\nHere, at our gates, your brave efforts unite,\\nTurn back the routed, and forbid the flight,\\nEre yet their wives’ soft arms the cowards gain,\\nThe sport and insult of the hostile train.\\nWhen your commands have hearten’d every band,\\nOurselves, here fix’d, will make the dangerous stand;\\nPress’d as we are, and sore of former fight,\\nThese straits demand our last remains of might.\\nMeanwhile thou, Hector, to the town retire,\\nAnd teach our mother what the gods require:\\nDirect the queen to lead the assembled train\\nOf Troy’s chief matrons to Minerva’s fane;[166]\\nUnbar the sacred gates, and seek the power,\\nWith offer’d vows, in Ilion’s topmost tower.\\nThe largest mantle her rich wardrobes hold,\\nMost prized for art, and labour’d o’er with gold,\\nBefore the goddess’ honour’d knees be spread,\\nAnd twelve young heifers to her altars led:\\nIf so the power, atoned by fervent prayer,\\nOur wives, our infants, and our city spare,\\nAnd far avert Tydides’ wasteful ire,\\nThat mows whole troops, and makes all Troy retire;\\nNot thus Achilles taught our hosts to dread,\\nSprung though he was from more than mortal bed;\\nNot thus resistless ruled the stream of fight,\\nIn rage unbounded, and unmatch’d in might.”\\n\\nHector obedient heard: and, with a bound,\\nLeap’d from his trembling chariot to the ground;\\nThrough all his host inspiring force he flies,\\nAnd bids the thunder of the battle rise.\\nWith rage recruited the bold Trojans glow,\\nAnd turn the tide of conflict on the foe:\\nFierce in the front he shakes two dazzling spears;\\nAll Greece recedes, and ’midst her triumphs fears;\\nSome god, they thought, who ruled the fate of wars,\\nShot down avenging from the vault of stars.\\n\\nThen thus aloud: “Ye dauntless Dardans, hear!\\nAnd you whom distant nations send to war!\\nBe mindful of the strength your fathers bore;\\nBe still yourselves, and Hector asks no more.\\nOne hour demands me in the Trojan wall,\\nTo bid our altars flame, and victims fall:\\nNor shall, I trust, the matrons’ holy train,\\nAnd reverend elders, seek the gods in vain.”\\n\\nThis said, with ample strides the hero pass’d;\\nThe shield’s large orb behind his shoulder cast,\\nHis neck o’ershading, to his ankle hung;\\nAnd as he march’d the brazen buckler rung.\\n\\nNow paused the battle (godlike Hector gone),[167]\\nWhere daring Glaucus and great Tydeus’ son\\nBetween both armies met: the chiefs from far\\nObserved each other, and had mark’d for war.\\nNear as they drew, Tydides thus began:\\n\\n“What art thou, boldest of the race of man?\\nOur eyes till now that aspect ne’er beheld,\\nWhere fame is reap’d amid the embattled field;\\nYet far before the troops thou dar’st appear,\\nAnd meet a lance the fiercest heroes fear.\\nUnhappy they, and born of luckless sires,\\nWho tempt our fury when Minerva fires!\\nBut if from heaven, celestial, thou descend,\\nKnow with immortals we no more contend.\\nNot long Lycurgus view’d the golden light,\\nThat daring man who mix’d with gods in fight.\\nBacchus, and Bacchus’ votaries, he drove,\\nWith brandish’d steel, from Nyssa’s sacred grove:\\nTheir consecrated spears lay scatter’d round,\\nWith curling vines and twisted ivy bound;\\nWhile Bacchus headlong sought the briny flood,\\nAnd Thetis’ arms received the trembling god.\\nNor fail’d the crime the immortals’ wrath to move;\\n(The immortals bless’d with endless ease above;)\\nDeprived of sight by their avenging doom,\\nCheerless he breathed, and wander’d in the gloom,\\nThen sunk unpitied to the dire abodes,\\nA wretch accursed, and hated by the gods!\\nI brave not heaven: but if the fruits of earth\\nSustain thy life, and human be thy birth,\\nBold as thou art, too prodigal of breath,\\nApproach, and enter the dark gates of death.”\\n\\n“What, or from whence I am, or who my sire,\\n(Replied the chief,) can Tydeus’ son inquire?\\nLike leaves on trees the race of man is found,\\nNow green in youth, now withering on the ground;\\nAnother race the following spring supplies;\\nThey fall successive, and successive rise:\\nSo generations in their course decay;\\nSo flourish these, when those are pass’d away.\\nBut if thou still persist to search my birth,\\nThen hear a tale that fills the spacious earth.\\n\\n“A city stands on Argos’ utmost bound,\\n(Argos the fair, for warlike steeds renown’d,)\\nÆolian Sisyphus, with wisdom bless’d,\\nIn ancient time the happy wall possess’d,\\nThen call’d Ephyre: Glaucus was his son;\\nGreat Glaucus, father of Bellerophon,\\nWho o’er the sons of men in beauty shined,\\nLoved for that valour which preserves mankind.\\nThen mighty Praetus Argos’ sceptre sway’d,\\nWhose hard commands Bellerophon obey’d.\\nWith direful jealousy the monarch raged,\\nAnd the brave prince in numerous toils engaged.\\nFor him Antaea burn’d with lawless flame,\\nAnd strove to tempt him from the paths of fame:\\nIn vain she tempted the relentless youth,\\nEndued with wisdom, sacred fear, and truth.\\nFired at his scorn the queen to Praetus fled,\\nAnd begg’d revenge for her insulted bed:\\nIncensed he heard, resolving on his fate;\\nBut hospitable laws restrain’d his hate:\\nTo Lycia the devoted youth he sent,\\nWith tablets seal’d, that told his dire intent.[168]\\nNow bless’d by every power who guards the good,\\nThe chief arrived at Xanthus’ silver flood:\\nThere Lycia’s monarch paid him honours due,\\nNine days he feasted, and nine bulls he slew.\\nBut when the tenth bright morning orient glow’d,\\nThe faithful youth his monarch’s mandate show’d:\\nThe fatal tablets, till that instant seal’d,\\nThe deathful secret to the king reveal’d.\\nFirst, dire Chimaera’s conquest was enjoin’d;\\nA mingled monster of no mortal kind!\\nBehind, a dragon’s fiery tail was spread;\\nA goat’s rough body bore a lion’s head;\\nHer pitchy nostrils flaky flames expire;\\nHer gaping throat emits infernal fire.\\n\\n“This pest he slaughter’d, (for he read the skies,\\nAnd trusted heaven’s informing prodigies,)\\nThen met in arms the Solymæan crew,[169]\\n(Fiercest of men,) and those the warrior slew;\\nNext the bold Amazons’ whole force defied;\\nAnd conquer’d still, for heaven was on his side.\\n\\n“Nor ended here his toils: his Lycian foes,\\nAt his return, a treacherous ambush rose,\\nWith levell’d spears along the winding shore:\\nThere fell they breathless, and return’d no more.\\n\\n“At length the monarch, with repentant grief,\\nConfess’d the gods, and god-descended chief;\\nHis daughter gave, the stranger to detain,\\nWith half the honours of his ample reign:\\nThe Lycians grant a chosen space of ground,\\nWith woods, with vineyards, and with harvests crown’d.\\nThere long the chief his happy lot possess’d,\\nWith two brave sons and one fair daughter bless’d;\\n(Fair e’en in heavenly eyes: her fruitful love\\nCrown’d with Sarpedon’s birth the embrace of Jove;)\\nBut when at last, distracted in his mind,\\nForsook by heaven, forsaking humankind,\\nWide o’er the Aleian field he chose to stray,\\nA long, forlorn, uncomfortable way![170]\\nWoes heap’d on woes consumed his wasted heart:\\nHis beauteous daughter fell by Phoebe’s dart;\\nHis eldest born by raging Mars was slain,\\nIn combat on the Solymaean plain.\\nHippolochus survived: from him I came,\\nThe honour’d author of my birth and name;\\nBy his decree I sought the Trojan town;\\nBy his instructions learn to win renown,\\nTo stand the first in worth as in command,\\nTo add new honours to my native land,\\nBefore my eyes my mighty sires to place,\\nAnd emulate the glories of our race.”\\n\\nHe spoke, and transport fill’d Tydides’ heart;\\nIn earth the generous warrior fix’d his dart,\\nThen friendly, thus the Lycian prince address’d:\\n“Welcome, my brave hereditary guest!\\nThus ever let us meet, with kind embrace,\\nNor stain the sacred friendship of our race.\\nKnow, chief, our grandsires have been guests of old;\\nŒneus the strong, Bellerophon the bold:\\nOur ancient seat his honour’d presence graced,\\nWhere twenty days in genial rites he pass’d.\\nThe parting heroes mutual presents left;\\nA golden goblet was thy grandsire’s gift;\\nŒneus a belt of matchless work bestowed,\\nThat rich with Tyrian dye refulgent glow’d.\\n(This from his pledge I learn’d, which, safely stored\\nAmong my treasures, still adorns my board:\\nFor Tydeus left me young, when Thebe’s wall\\nBeheld the sons of Greece untimely fall.)\\nMindful of this, in friendship let us join;\\nIf heaven our steps to foreign lands incline,\\nMy guest in Argos thou, and I in Lycia thine.\\nEnough of Trojans to this lance shall yield,\\nIn the full harvest of yon ample field;\\nEnough of Greeks shall dye thy spear with gore;\\nBut thou and Diomed be foes no more.\\nNow change we arms, and prove to either host\\nWe guard the friendship of the line we boast.”\\n\\nThus having said, the gallant chiefs alight,\\nTheir hands they join, their mutual faith they plight;\\nBrave Glaucus then each narrow thought resign’d,\\n(Jove warm’d his bosom, and enlarged his mind,)\\nFor Diomed’s brass arms, of mean device,\\nFor which nine oxen paid, (a vulgar price,)\\nHe gave his own, of gold divinely wrought,[171]\\nA hundred beeves the shining purchase bought.\\n\\nMeantime the guardian of the Trojan state,\\nGreat Hector, enter’d at the Scæan gate.[172]\\nBeneath the beech-tree’s consecrated shades,\\nThe Trojan matrons and the Trojan maids\\nAround him flock’d, all press’d with pious care\\nFor husbands, brothers, sons, engaged in war.\\nHe bids the train in long procession go,\\nAnd seek the gods, to avert the impending woe.\\nAnd now to Priam’s stately courts he came,\\nRais’d on arch’d columns of stupendous frame;\\nO’er these a range of marble structure runs,\\nThe rich pavilions of his fifty sons,\\nIn fifty chambers lodged: and rooms of state,[173]\\nOpposed to those, where Priam’s daughters sate.\\nTwelve domes for them and their loved spouses shone,\\nOf equal beauty, and of polish’d stone.\\nHither great Hector pass’d, nor pass’d unseen\\nOf royal Hecuba, his mother-queen.\\n(With her Laodice, whose beauteous face\\nSurpass’d the nymphs of Troy’s illustrious race.)\\nLong in a strict embrace she held her son,\\nAnd press’d his hand, and tender thus begun:\\n\\n“O Hector! say, what great occasion calls\\nMy son from fight, when Greece surrounds our walls;\\nCom’st thou to supplicate the almighty power\\nWith lifted hands, from Ilion’s lofty tower?\\nStay, till I bring the cup with Bacchus crown’d,\\nIn Jove’s high name, to sprinkle on the ground,\\nAnd pay due vows to all the gods around.\\nThen with a plenteous draught refresh thy soul,\\nAnd draw new spirits from the generous bowl;\\nSpent as thou art with long laborious fight,\\nThe brave defender of thy country’s right.”\\n\\n“Far hence be Bacchus’ gifts; (the chief rejoin’d;)\\nInflaming wine, pernicious to mankind,\\nUnnerves the limbs, and dulls the noble mind.\\nLet chiefs abstain, and spare the sacred juice\\nTo sprinkle to the gods, its better use.\\nBy me that holy office were profaned;\\nIll fits it me, with human gore distain’d,\\nTo the pure skies these horrid hands to raise,\\nOr offer heaven’s great Sire polluted praise.\\nYou, with your matrons, go! a spotless train,\\nAnd burn rich odours in Minerva’s fane.\\nThe largest mantle your full wardrobes hold,\\nMost prized for art, and labour’d o’er with gold,\\nBefore the goddess’ honour’d knees be spread,\\nAnd twelve young heifers to her altar led.\\nSo may the power, atoned by fervent prayer,\\nOur wives, our infants, and our city spare;\\nAnd far avert Tydides’ wasteful ire,\\nWho mows whole troops, and makes all Troy retire.\\nBe this, O mother, your religious care:\\nI go to rouse soft Paris to the war;\\nIf yet not lost to all the sense of shame,\\nThe recreant warrior hear the voice of fame.\\nOh, would kind earth the hateful wretch embrace,\\nThat pest of Troy, that ruin of our race![174]\\nDeep to the dark abyss might he descend,\\nTroy yet should flourish, and my sorrows end.”\\n\\nThis heard, she gave command: and summon’d came\\nEach noble matron and illustrious dame.\\nThe Phrygian queen to her rich wardrobe went,\\nWhere treasured odours breathed a costly scent.\\nThere lay the vestures of no vulgar art,\\nSidonian maids embroider’d every part,\\nWhom from soft Sidon youthful Paris bore,\\nWith Helen touching on the Tyrian shore.\\nHere, as the queen revolved with careful eyes\\nThe various textures and the various dyes,\\nShe chose a veil that shone superior far,\\nAnd glow’d refulgent as the morning star.\\nHerself with this the long procession leads;\\nThe train majestically slow proceeds.\\nSoon as to Ilion’s topmost tower they come,\\nAnd awful reach the high Palladian dome,\\nAntenor’s consort, fair Theano, waits\\nAs Pallas’ priestess, and unbars the gates.\\nWith hands uplifted and imploring eyes,\\nThey fill the dome with supplicating cries.\\nThe priestess then the shining veil displays,\\nPlaced on Minerva’s knees, and thus she prays:\\n\\n“Oh awful goddess! ever-dreadful maid,\\nTroy’s strong defence, unconquer’d Pallas, aid!\\nBreak thou Tydides’ spear, and let him fall\\nProne on the dust before the Trojan wall!\\nSo twelve young heifers, guiltless of the yoke,\\nShall fill thy temple with a grateful smoke.\\nBut thou, atoned by penitence and prayer,\\nOurselves, our infants, and our city spare!”\\nSo pray’d the priestess in her holy fane;\\nSo vow’d the matrons, but they vow’d in vain.\\n\\nWhile these appear before the power with prayers,\\nHector to Paris’ lofty dome repairs.[175]\\nHimself the mansion raised, from every part\\nAssembling architects of matchless art.\\nNear Priam’s court and Hector’s palace stands\\nThe pompous structure, and the town commands.\\nA spear the hero bore of wondrous strength,\\nOf full ten cubits was the lance’s length,\\nThe steely point with golden ringlets join’d,\\nBefore him brandish’d, at each motion shined\\nThus entering, in the glittering rooms he found\\nHis brother-chief, whose useless arms lay round,\\nHis eyes delighting with their splendid show,\\nBrightening the shield, and polishing the bow.\\nBeside him Helen with her virgins stands,\\nGuides their rich labours, and instructs their hands.\\n\\nHim thus inactive, with an ardent look\\nThe prince beheld, and high-resenting spoke.\\n“Thy hate to Troy, is this the time to show?\\n(O wretch ill-fated, and thy country’s foe!)\\nParis and Greece against us both conspire,\\nThy close resentment, and their vengeful ire.\\nFor thee great Ilion’s guardian heroes fall,\\nTill heaps of dead alone defend her wall,\\nFor thee the soldier bleeds, the matron mourns,\\nAnd wasteful war in all its fury burns.\\nUngrateful man! deserves not this thy care,\\nOur troops to hearten, and our toils to share?\\nRise, or behold the conquering flames ascend,\\nAnd all the Phrygian glories at an end.”\\n\\n“Brother, ’tis just, (replied the beauteous youth,)\\nThy free remonstrance proves thy worth and truth:\\nYet charge my absence less, O generous chief!\\nOn hate to Troy, than conscious shame and grief:\\nHere, hid from human eyes, thy brother sate,\\nAnd mourn’d, in secret, his and Ilion’s fate.\\n’Tis now enough; now glory spreads her charms,\\nAnd beauteous Helen calls her chief to arms.\\nConquest to-day my happier sword may bless,\\n’Tis man’s to fight, but heaven’s

Nine of the princes accepting the\\nchallenge, the lot is cast and falls upon Ajax. These heroes, after\\nseveral attacks, are parted by the night. The Trojans calling a\\ncouncil, Antenor purposes the delivery of Helen to the Greeks, to which\\nParis will not consent, but offers to restore them her riches. Priam\\nsends a herald to make this offer, and to demand a truce for burning\\nthe dead, the last of which only is agreed to by Agamemnon. When the\\nfunerals are performed, the Greeks, pursuant to the advice of Nestor,\\nerect a fortification to protect their fleet and camp, flanked with\\ntowers, and defended by a ditch and palisades. Neptune testifies his\\njealousy at this work, but is pacified by a promise from Jupiter. Both\\narmies pass the night in feasting but Jupiter disheartens the Trojans\\nwith thunder, and other signs of his wrath.\\n    The three and twentieth day ends with the duel of Hector and Ajax,\\n    the next day the truce is agreed; another is taken up in the\\n    funeral rites of the slain and one more in building the\\n    fortification before the ships.

and the shades of night,\\nGreece on her sable ships attempt her flight.\\nNot unmolested let the wretches gain\\nTheir lofty decks, or safely cleave the main;\\nSome hostile wound let every dart bestow,\\nSome lasting token of the Phrygian foe,\\nWounds, that long hence may ask their spouses’ care.\\nAnd warn their children from a Trojan war.\\nNow through the circuit of our Ilion wall,\\nLet sacred heralds sound the solemn call;\\nTo bid the sires with hoary honours crown’d,\\nAnd beardless youths, our battlements surround.\\nFirm be the guard, while distant lie our powers,\\nAnd let the matrons hang with lights the towers;\\nLest, under covert of the midnight shade,\\nThe insidious foe the naked town invade.\\nSuffice, to-night, these orders to obey;\\nA nobler charge shall rouse the dawning day.\\nThe gods, I trust, shall give to Hector’s hand\\nFrom these detested foes to free the land,\\nWho plough’d, with fates averse, the watery way:\\nFor Trojan vultures a predestined prey.\\nOur common safety must be now the care;\\nBut soon as morning paints the fields of air,\\nSheathed in bright arms let every troop engage,\\nAnd the fired fleet behold the battle rage.\\nThen,

Diomed opposes this, and Nestor\\nseconds him, praising his wisdom and resolution. He orders the guard to\\nbe strengthened, and a council summoned to deliberate what measures are\\nto be followed in this emergency. Agamemnon pursues this advice, and\\nNestor further prevails upon him to send ambassadors to Achilles, in\\norder to move him to a reconciliation. Ulysses and Ajax are made choice\\nof, who are accompanied by old Phœnix. They make, each of them, very\\nmoving and pressing speeches, but are rejected with roughness by\\nAchilles, who notwithstanding retains Phœnix in his tent. The\\nambassadors return unsuccessfully to the camp, and the troops betake\\nthemselves to sleep.\\n    This book, and the next following, take up the space of one night,\\n    which is the twenty-seventh from the beginning of the poem. The\\n    scene lies on the sea-shore, the station of the Grecian ships.\\n\\n\\nThus joyful Troy maintain’d the watch of night;\\nWhile fear, pale comrade of inglorious flight,[199]\\nAnd heaven-bred horror, on the Grecian part,\\nSat on each face, and sadden’d every heart.\\nAs from its cloudy dungeon issuing forth,\\nA double tempest of the west and north\\nSwells o’er the sea, from Thracia’s frozen shore,\\nHeaps waves on waves, and bids the Ægean roar:\\nThis way and that the boiling deeps are toss’d:\\nSuch various passions urged the troubled host,\\nGreat Agamemnon grieved above the rest;\\nSuperior sorrows swell’d his royal breast;\\nHimself his orders to the heralds bears,\\nTo bid to council all the Grecian peers,\\nBut bid in whispers: these surround their chief,\\nIn solemn sadness and majestic grief.\\nThe king amidst the mournful circle rose:\\nDown his wan cheek a briny torrent flows.\\nSo silent fountains, from a rock’s tall head,\\nIn sable streams soft-trickling waters shed.\\nWith more than vulgar grief he stood oppress’d;\\nWords, mix’d with sighs, thus bursting from his breast:\\n\\n“Ye sons of Greece! partake your leader’s care;\\nFellows in arms and princes of the war!\\nOf partial Jove too justly we complain,\\nAnd heavenly oracles believed in vain.\\nA safe return was promised to our toils,\\nWith conquest honour’d and enrich’d with spoils:\\nNow shameful flight alone can save the host;\\nOur wealth, our people, and our glory lost.\\nSo Jove decrees, almighty lord of all!\\nJove, at whose nod whole empires rise or fall,\\nWho shakes the feeble props of human trust,\\nAnd towers and armies humbles to the dust.\\nHaste then, for ever quit these fatal fields,\\nHaste to the joys our native country yields;\\nSpread all your canvas, all your oars employ,\\nNor hope the fall of heaven-defended Troy.”\\n\\nHe said: deep silence held the Grecian band;\\nSilent, unmov’d in dire dismay they stand;\\nA pensive scene! till Tydeus’ warlike son\\nRoll’d on the king his eyes, and thus begun:\\n“When kings advise us to renounce our fame,\\nFirst let him speak who first has suffer’d shame.\\nIf I oppose thee, prince! thy wrath withhold,\\nThe laws of council bid my tongue be bold.\\nThou first, and thou alone, in fields of fight,\\nDurst brand my courage, and defame my might:\\nNor from a friend the unkind reproach appear’d,\\nThe Greeks stood witness, all our army heard.\\nThe gods, O chief! from whom our honours spring,\\nThe gods have made thee but by halves a king:\\nThey gave thee sceptres, and a wide command;\\nThey gave dominion o’er the seas and land;\\nThe noblest power that might the world control\\nThey gave thee not—a brave and virtuous soul.\\nIs this a general’s voice, that would suggest\\nFears like his own to every Grecian breast?\\nConfiding in our want of worth, he stands;\\nAnd if we fly, ’tis what our king commands.\\nGo thou, inglorious! from the embattled plain;\\nShips thou hast store, and nearest to the main;\\nA noble care the Grecians shall employ,\\nTo combat, conquer, and extirpate Troy.\\nHere Greece shall stay; or, if all Greece retire,\\nMyself shall stay, till Troy or I expire;\\nMyself, and Sthenelus, will fight for fame;\\nGod bade us fight, and ’twas with God we came.”\\n\\nHe ceased; the Greeks loud acclamations raise,\\nAnd voice to voice resounds Tydides’ praise.\\nWise Nestor then his reverend figure rear’d;\\nHe spoke: the host in still attention heard:[200]\\n\\n“O truly great! in whom the gods have join’d\\nSuch strength of body with such force of mind:\\nIn conduct, as in courage, you excel,\\nStill first to act what you advise so well.\\nThese wholesome counsels which thy wisdom moves,\\nApplauding Greece with common voice approves.\\nKings thou canst blame; a bold but prudent youth:\\nAnd blame even kings with praise, because with truth.\\nAnd yet those years that since thy birth have run\\nWould hardly style thee Nestor’s youngest son.\\nThen let me add what yet remains behind,\\nA thought unfinish’d in that generous mind;\\nAge bids me speak!

but at the tyrant’s name\\nMy rage rekindles, and my soul’s on flame:\\n’Tis just resentment, and becomes the brave:\\nDisgraced, dishonour’d, like the vilest slave!\\nReturn, then, heroes! and our answer bear,\\nThe glorious combat is no more my care;\\nNot till, amidst yon sinking navy slain,\\nThe blood of Greeks shall dye the sable main;\\nNot till the flames, by Hector’s fury thrown,\\nConsume your vessels, and approach my own;\\nJust there, the impetuous homicide shall stand,\\nThere cease his battle, and there feel our hand.”\\n\\nThis said, each prince a double goblet crown’d,\\nAnd cast a large libation on the ground;\\nThen to their vessels, through the gloomy shades,\\nThe chiefs return; divine Ulysses leads.\\nMeantime Achilles’ slaves prepared a bed,\\nWith fleeces, carpets, and soft linen spread:\\nThere, till the sacred morn restored the day,\\nIn slumber sweet the reverend Phœnix lay.\\nBut in his inner tent, an ampler space,\\nAchilles slept; and in his warm embrace\\nFair Diomede of the Lesbian race.\\nLast, for Patroclus was the couch prepared,\\nWhose nightly joys the beauteous Iphis shared;\\nAchilles to his friend consign’d her charms\\nWhen Scyros fell before his conquering arms.\\n\\nAnd now the elected chiefs whom Greece had sent,\\nPass’d through the hosts, and reach’d the royal tent.\\nThen rising all, with goblets in their hands,\\nThe peers and leaders of the Achaian bands\\nHail’d their return: Atrides first begun:\\n\\n“Say what success? divine Laertes’ son!\\nAchilles’ high resolves declare to all:\\nReturns the chief, or must our navy fall?”\\n\\n“Great king of nations! (Ithacus replied)\\nFix’d is his wrath, unconquer’d is his pride;\\nHe slights thy friendship, thy proposals scorns,\\nAnd, thus implored, with fiercer fury burns.\\nTo save our army, and our fleets to free,\\nIs not his care; but left to Greece and thee.\\nYour eyes shall view, when morning paints the sky,\\nBeneath his oars the whitening billows fly;\\nUs too he bids our oars and sails employ,\\nNor hope the fall of heaven-protected Troy;\\nFor Jove o’ershades her with his arm divine,\\nInspires her war, and bids her glory shine.\\nSuch was his word: what further he declared,\\nThese sacred heralds and great Ajax heard.\\nBut Phœnix in his tent the chief retains,\\nSafe to transport him to his native plains\\nWhen morning dawns; if other he decree,\\nHis age is sacred, and his choice is free.”\\n\\nUlysses ceased: the great Achaian host,\\nWith sorrow seized, in consternation lost,\\nAttend the stern reply. Tydides broke\\nThe general silence, and undaunted spoke.\\n“Why should we gifts to proud Achilles send,\\nOr strive with prayers his haughty soul to bend?\\nHis country’s woes he glories to deride,\\nAnd prayers will burst that swelling heart with pride.\\nBe the fierce impulse of his rage obey’d,\\nOur battles let him or desert or aid;\\nThen let him arm when Jove or he think fit:\\nThat, to his madness, or to Heaven commit:\\nWhat for ourselves we can, is always ours;\\nThis night, let due repast refresh our powers;\\n(For strength consists in spirits and in blood,\\nAnd those are owed to generous wine and food;)\\nBut when the rosy messenger of day\\nStrikes the blue mountains with her golden ray,\\nRanged at the ships, let all our squadrons shine\\nIn flaming arms, a long-extended line:\\nIn the dread front let great Atrides stand,\\nThe first in danger, as in high command.”\\n\\nShouts of acclaim the listening heroes raise,\\nThen each to Heaven the due libations pays;\\nTill sleep, descending o’er the tents, bestows\\nThe grateful blessings of desired repose.[214]\\n\\n\\n[Illustration: ] ACHILLES\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBOOK X.\\n\\n\\nARGUMENT.\\n\\n\\nTHE NIGHT-ADVENTURE OF DIOMED AND ULYSSES.\\n\\n\\nUpon the refusal of Achilles to return to the army, the distress of\\nAgamemnon is described in the most lively manner. He takes no rest that\\nnight, but passes through the camp, awaking the leaders, and contriving\\nall possible methods for the public safety. Menelaus, Nestor, Ulysses,\\nand Diomed are employed in raising the rest of the captains. They call\\na council of war, and determine to send scouts into the enemies’ camp,\\nto learn their posture, and discover their intentions. Diomed\\nundertakes this hazardous enterprise, and makes choice of Ulysses for\\nhis companion. In their passage they surprise Dolon, whom Hector had\\nsent on a like design to the camp of the Grecians. From him they are\\ninformed of the situation of the Trojan and auxiliary forces, and\\nparticularly of Rhesus, and the Thracians who were lately arrived. They\\npass on with success; kill Rhesus, with several of his officers, and\\nseize the famous horses of that prince, with which they return in\\ntriumph to the camp.\\n    The same night continues; the scene lies in the two camps.\\n\\n\\nAll night the chiefs before their vessels lay,\\nAnd lost in sleep the labours of the day:\\nAll but the king: with various thoughts oppress’d,[215]\\nHis country’s cares lay rolling in his breast.\\nAs when by lightnings Jove’s ethereal power\\nForetels the rattling hail, or weighty shower,\\nOr sends soft snows to whiten all the shore,\\nOr bids the brazen throat of war to roar;\\nBy fits one flash succeeds as one expires,\\nAnd heaven flames thick with momentary fires:\\nSo bursting frequent from Atrides’ breast,\\nSighs following sighs his inward fears confess’d.\\nNow o’er the fields, dejected, he surveys\\nFrom thousand Trojan fires the mounting blaze;\\nHears in the passing wind their music blow,\\nAnd marks distinct the voices of the foe.\\nNow looking backwards to the fleet and coast,\\nAnxious he sorrows for the endangered host.\\nHe rends his hair, in sacrifice to Jove,\\nAnd sues to him that ever lives above:\\nInly he groans; while glory and despair\\nDivide his heart, and wage a double war.\\n\\nA thousand cares his labouring breast revolves;\\nTo seek sage Nestor now the chief resolves,\\nWith him, in wholesome counsels, to debate\\nWhat yet remains to save the afflicted state.\\nHe rose, and first he cast his mantle round,\\nNext on his feet the shining sandals bound;\\nA lion’s yellow spoils his back conceal’d;\\nHis warlike hand a pointed javelin held.\\nMeanwhile his brother, press’d with equal woes,\\nAlike denied the gifts of soft repose,\\nLaments for Greece, that in his cause before\\nSo much had suffer’d and must suffer more.\\nA leopard’s spotted hide his shoulders spread:\\nA brazen helmet glitter’d on his head:\\nThus (with a javelin in his hand) he went\\nTo wake Atrides in the royal tent.\\nAlready waked, Atrides he descried,\\nHis armour buckling at his vessel’s side.\\nJoyful they met; the Spartan thus begun:\\n“Why puts my brother his bright armour on?\\nSends he some spy, amidst these silent hours,\\nTo try yon camp, and watch the Trojan powers?\\nBut say, what hero shall sustain that task?\\nSuch bold exploits uncommon courage ask;\\nGuideless, alone, through night’s dark shade to go,\\nAnd midst a hostile camp explore the foe.”\\n\\nTo whom the king: “In such distress we stand,\\nNo vulgar counsel our affairs demand;\\nGreece to preserve, is now no easy part,\\nBut asks high wisdom, deep design, and art.\\nFor Jove, averse, our humble prayer denies,\\nAnd bows his head to Hector’s sacrifice.\\nWhat eye has witness’d, or what ear believed,\\nIn one great day, by one great arm achieved,\\nSuch wondrous deeds as Hector’s hand has done,\\nAnd we beheld, the last revolving sun?\\nWhat honours the beloved of Jove adorn!\\nSprung from no god, and of no goddess born;\\nYet such his acts, as Greeks unborn shall tell,\\nAnd curse the battle where their fathers fell.\\n\\n“Now speed thy hasty course along the fleet,\\nThere call great Ajax, and the prince of Crete;\\nOurself to hoary Nestor will repair;\\nTo keep the guards on duty be his care,\\n(For Nestor’s influence best that quarter guides,\\nWhose son with Merion, o’er the watch presides.”)\\nTo whom the Spartan: “These thy orders borne,\\nSay, shall I stay, or with despatch return?”\\n“There shall thou stay, (the king of men replied,)\\nElse may we miss to meet, without a guide,\\nThe paths so many, and the camp so wide.\\nStill, with your voice the slothful soldiers raise,\\nUrge by their fathers’ fame their future praise.\\nForget we now our state and lofty birth;\\nNot titles here, but works, must prove our worth.\\nTo labour is the lot of man below;\\nAnd when Jove gave us life, he gave us woe.”\\n\\nThis said, each parted to his several cares:\\nThe king to Nestor’s sable ship repairs;\\nThe sage protector of the Greeks he found\\nStretch’d in his bed with all his arms around;\\nThe various-colour’d scarf, the shield he rears,\\nThe shining helmet, and the pointed spears;\\nThe dreadful weapons of the warrior’s rage,\\nThat, old in arms, disdain’d the peace of age.\\nThen, leaning on his hand his watchful head,\\nThe hoary monarch raised his eyes and said:\\n\\n“What art thou, speak, that on designs unknown,\\nWhile others sleep, thus range the camp alone;\\nSeek’st thou some friend or nightly sentinel?\\nStand off, approach not, but thy purpose tell.”\\n\\n“O son of Neleus, (thus the king rejoin’d,)\\nPride of the Greeks, and glory of thy kind!\\nLo, here the wretched Agamemnon stands,\\nThe unhappy general of the Grecian bands,\\nWhom Jove decrees with daily cares to bend,\\nAnd woes, that only with his life shall end!\\nScarce can my knees these trembling limbs sustain,\\nAnd scarce my heart support its load of pain.\\nNo taste of sleep these heavy eyes have known,\\nConfused, and sad, I wander thus alone,\\nWith fears distracted, with no fix’d design;\\nAnd all my people’s miseries are mine.\\nIf aught of use thy waking thoughts suggest,\\n(Since cares, like mine, deprive thy soul of rest,)\\nImpart thy counsel, and assist thy friend;\\nNow let us jointly to the trench descend,\\nAt every gate the fainting guard excite,\\nTired with the toils of day and watch of night;\\nElse may the sudden foe our works invade,\\nSo near, and favour’d by the gloomy shade.”\\n\\nTo him thus Nestor: “Trust the powers above,\\nNor think proud Hector’s hopes confirm’d by Jove:\\nHow ill agree the views of vain mankind,\\nAnd the wise counsels of the eternal mind!\\nAudacious Hector, if the gods ordain\\nThat great Achilles rise and rage again,\\nWhat toils attend thee, and what woes remain!\\nLo, faithful Nestor thy command obeys;\\nThe care is next our other chiefs to raise:\\nUlysses, Diomed, we chiefly need;\\nMeges for strength, Oïleus famed for speed.\\nSome other be despatch’d of nimbler feet,\\nTo those tall ships, remotest of the fleet,\\nWhere lie great Ajax and the king of Crete.[216]\\nTo rouse the Spartan I myself decree;\\nDear as he is to us, and dear to thee,\\nYet must I tax his sloth, that claims no share\\nWith his great brother in his martial care:\\nHim it behoved to every chief to sue,\\nPreventing every part perform’d by you;\\nFor strong necessity our toils demands,\\nClaims all our hearts, and urges all our hands.”\\n\\nTo whom the king: “With reverence we allow\\nThy just rebukes, yet learn to spare them now:\\nMy generous brother is of gentle kind,\\nHe seems remiss, but bears a valiant mind;\\nThrough too much deference to our sovereign sway,\\nContent to follow when we lead the way:\\nBut now, our ills industrious to prevent,\\nLong ere the rest he rose, and sought my tent.\\nThe chiefs you named, already at his call,\\nPrepare to meet us near the navy-wall;\\nAssembling there, between the trench and gates,\\nNear the night-guards, our chosen council waits.”\\n\\n“Then none (said Nestor) shall his rule withstand,\\nFor great examples justify command.”\\nWith that, the venerable warrior rose;\\nThe shining greaves his manly legs enclose;\\nHis purple mantle golden buckles join’d,\\nWarm with the softest wool, and doubly lined.\\nThen rushing from his tent, he snatch’d in haste\\nHis steely lance, that lighten’d as he pass’d.\\nThe camp he traversed through the sleeping crowd,\\nStopp’d at Ulysses’ tent, and call’d aloud.\\nUlysses, sudden as the voice was sent,\\nAwakes, starts up, and issues from his tent.\\n“What new distress, what sudden cause of fright,\\nThus leads you wandering in the silent night?”\\n“O prudent chief! (the Pylian sage replied)\\nWise as thou art, be now thy wisdom tried:\\nWhatever means of safety can be sought,\\nWhatever counsels can inspire our thought,\\nWhatever methods, or to fly or fight;\\nAll, all depend on this important night!”\\nHe heard, return’d, and took his painted shield;\\nThen join’d the chiefs, and follow’d through the field.\\nWithout his tent, bold Diomed they found,\\nAll sheathed in arms, his brave companions round:\\nEach sunk in sleep, extended on the field,\\nHis head reclining on his bossy shield.\\nA wood of spears stood by, that, fix’d upright,\\nShot from their flashing points a quivering light.\\nA bull’s black hide composed the hero’s bed;\\nA splendid carpet roll’d beneath his head.\\nThen, with his foot, old Nestor gently shakes\\nThe slumbering chief, and in these words awakes:\\n\\n“Rise, son of Tydeus! to the brave and strong\\nRest seems inglorious, and the night too long.\\nBut sleep’st thou now, when from yon hill the foe\\nHangs o’er the fleet, and shades our walls below?”\\n\\nAt this, soft slumber from his eyelids fled;\\nThe warrior saw the hoary chief, and said:\\n“Wondrous old man! whose soul no respite knows,\\nThough years and honours bid thee seek repose,\\nLet younger Greeks our sleeping warriors wake;\\nIll fits thy age these toils to undertake.”\\n“My friend, (he answered,) generous is thy care;\\nThese toils, my subjects and my sons might bear;\\nTheir loyal thoughts and pious love conspire\\nTo ease a sovereign and relieve a sire:\\nBut now the last despair surrounds our host;\\nNo hour must pass, no moment must be lost;\\nEach single Greek, in this conclusive strife,\\nStands on the sharpest edge of death or life:\\nYet, if my years thy kind regard engage,\\nEmploy thy youth as I employ my age;\\nSucceed to these my cares, and rouse the rest;\\nHe serves me most, who serves his country best.”\\n\\nThis said, the hero o’er his shoulders flung\\nA lion’s spoils, that to his ankles hung;\\nThen seized his ponderous lance, and strode along.\\nMeges the bold, with Ajax famed for speed,\\nThe warrior roused, and to the entrenchments lead.\\n\\nAnd now the chiefs approach the nightly guard;\\nA wakeful squadron, each in arms prepared:\\nThe unwearied watch their listening leaders keep,\\nAnd, couching close, repel invading sleep.\\nSo faithful dogs their fleecy charge maintain,\\nWith toil protected from the prowling train;\\nWhen the gaunt lioness, with hunger bold,\\nSprings from the mountains toward the guarded fold:\\nThrough breaking woods her rustling course they hear;\\nLoud, and more loud, the clamours strike their ear\\nOf hounds and men: they start, they gaze around,\\nWatch every side, and turn to every sound.\\nThus watch’d the Grecians, cautious of surprise,\\nEach voice, each motion, drew their ears and eyes:\\nEach step of passing feet increased the affright;\\nAnd hostile Troy was ever full in sight.\\nNestor with joy the wakeful band survey’d,\\nAnd thus accosted through the gloomy shade.\\n“’Tis well, my sons! your nightly cares employ;\\nElse must our host become the scorn of Troy.\\nWatch thus, and Greece shall live.” The hero said;\\nThen o’er the trench the following chieftains led.\\nHis son, and godlike Merion, march’d behind\\n(For these the princes to their council join’d).\\nThe trenches pass’d, the assembled kings around\\nIn silent state the consistory crown’d.\\nA place there was, yet undefiled with gore,\\nThe spot where Hector stopp’d his rage before;\\nWhen night descending, from his vengeful hand\\nReprieved the relics of the Grecian band:\\n(The plain beside with mangled corps was spread,\\nAnd all his progress mark’d by heaps of dead:)\\nThere sat the mournful kings: when Neleus’ son,\\nThe council opening, in these words begun:\\n\\n“Is there (said he) a chief so greatly brave,\\nHis life to hazard, and his country save?\\nLives there a man, who singly dares to go\\nTo yonder camp, or seize some straggling foe?\\nOr favour’d by the night approach so near,\\nTheir speech, their counsels, and designs to hear?\\nIf to besiege our navies they prepare,\\nOr Troy once more must be the seat of war?\\nThis could he learn, and to our peers recite,\\nAnd pass unharm’d the dangers of the night;\\nWhat fame were his through all succeeding days,\\nWhile Phœbus shines, or men have tongues to praise!\\nWhat gifts his grateful country would bestow!\\nWhat must not Greece to her deliverer owe?\\nA sable ewe each leader should provide,\\nWith each a sable lambkin by her side;\\nAt every rite his share should be increased,\\nAnd his the foremost honours of the feast.”\\n\\nFear held them mute: alone, untaught to fear,\\nTydides spoke—“The man you seek is here.\\nThrough yon black camps to bend my dangerous way,\\nSome god within commands, and I obey.\\nBut let some other chosen warrior join,\\nTo raise my hopes, and second my design.\\nBy mutual confidence and mutual aid,\\nGreat deeds are done, and great discoveries made;\\nThe wise new prudence from the wise acquire,\\nAnd one brave hero fans another’s fire.”\\n\\nContending leaders at the word arose;\\nEach generous breast with emulation glows;\\nSo brave a task each Ajax strove to share,\\nBold Merion strove, and Nestor’s valiant heir;\\nThe Spartan wish’d the second place to gain,\\nAnd great Ulysses wish’d, nor wish’d in vain.\\nThen thus the king of men the contest ends:\\n“Thou first of warriors, and thou best of friends,\\nUndaunted Diomed! what chief to join\\nIn this great enterprise, is only thine.\\nJust be thy choice, without affection made;\\nTo birth, or office, no respect be paid;\\nLet worth determine here.” The monarch spake,\\nAnd inly trembled for his brother’s sake.\\n\\n“Then thus (the godlike Diomed rejoin’d)\\nMy choice declares the impulse of my mind.\\nHow can I doubt, while great Ulysses stands\\nTo lend his counsels and assist our hands?\\nA chief, whose safety is Minerva’s care;\\nSo famed, so dreadful, in the works of war:\\nBless’d in his conduct, I no aid require;\\nWisdom like his might pass through flames of fire.”\\n\\n“It fits thee not, before these chiefs of fame,\\n(Replied the sage,) to praise me, or to blame:\\nPraise from a friend, or censure from a foe,\\nAre lost on hearers that our merits know.\\nBut let us haste—Night rolls the hours away,\\nThe reddening orient shows the coming day,\\nThe stars shine fainter on the ethereal plains,\\nAnd of night’s empire but a third remains.”\\n\\nThus having spoke, with generous ardour press’d,\\nIn arms terrific their huge limbs they dress’d.\\nA two-edged falchion Thrasymed the brave,\\nAnd ample buckler, to Tydides gave:\\nThen in a leathern helm he cased his head,\\nShort of its crest, and with no plume o’erspread:\\n(Such as by youths unused to arms are worn:)\\nNo spoils enrich it, and no studs adorn.\\nNext him Ulysses took a shining sword,\\nA bow and quiver, with bright arrows stored:\\nA well-proved casque, with leather braces bound,\\n(Thy gift, Meriones,) his temples crown’d;\\nSoft wool within; without, in order spread,[217]\\nA boar’s white teeth grinn’d horrid o’er his head.\\nThis from Amyntor, rich Ormenus’ son,\\nAutolycus by fraudful rapine won,\\nAnd gave Amphidamas; from him the prize\\nMolus received, the pledge of social ties;\\nThe helmet next by Merion was possess’d,\\nAnd now Ulysses’ thoughtful temples press’d.\\nThus sheathed in arms, the council they forsake,\\nAnd dark through paths oblique their progress take.\\nJust then, in sign she favour’d their intent,\\nA long-wing’d heron great Minerva sent:\\nThis, though surrounding shades obscured their view,\\nBy the shrill clang and whistling wings they knew.\\nAs from the right she soar’d, Ulysses pray’d,\\nHail’d the glad omen, and address’d the maid:\\n\\n“O daughter of that god whose arm can wield\\nThe avenging bolt, and shake the saber shield!\\nO thou! for ever present in my way,\\nWho all my motions, all my toils survey!\\nSafe may we pass beneath the gloomy shade,\\nSafe by thy succour to our ships convey’d,\\nAnd let some deed this signal night adorn,\\nTo claim the tears of Trojans yet unborn.”\\n\\nThen godlike Diomed preferr’d his prayer:\\n“Daughter of Jove, unconquer’d Pallas! hear.\\nGreat queen of arms, whose favour Tydeus won,\\nAs thou defend’st the sire, defend the son.\\nWhen on Æsopus’ banks the banded powers\\nOf Greece he left, and sought the Theban towers,\\nPeace was his charge; received with peaceful show,\\nHe went a legate, but return’d a foe:\\nThen help’d by thee, and cover’d by thy shield,\\nHe fought with numbers, and made numbers yield.\\nSo now be present, O celestial maid!\\nSo still continue to the race thine aid!\\nA youthful steer shall fall beneath the stroke,\\nUntamed, unconscious of the galling yoke,\\nWith ample forehead, and with spreading horns,\\nWhose taper tops refulgent gold adorns.”\\nThe heroes pray’d, and Pallas from the skies\\nAccords their vow, succeeds their enterprise.\\nNow, like two lions panting for the prey,\\nWith dreadful thoughts they trace the dreary way,\\nThrough the black horrors of the ensanguined plain,\\nThrough dust, through blood, o’er arms, and hills of slain.\\n\\nNor less bold Hector, and the sons of Troy,\\nOn high designs the wakeful hours employ;\\nThe assembled peers their lofty chief enclosed;\\nWho thus the counsels of his breast proposed:\\n\\n“What glorious man, for high attempts prepared,\\nDares greatly venture for a rich reward?\\nOf yonder fleet a bold discovery make,\\nWhat watch they keep, and what resolves they take?\\nIf now subdued they meditate their flight,\\nAnd, spent with toil, neglect the watch of night?\\nHis be the chariot that shall please him most,\\nOf all the plunder of the vanquish’d host;\\nHis the fair steeds that all the rest excel,\\nAnd his the glory to have served so well.”\\n\\nA youth there was among the tribes of Troy,\\nDolon his name, Eumedes’ only boy,\\n(Five girls beside the reverend herald told.)\\nRich was the son in brass, and rich in gold;\\nNot bless’d by nature with the charms of face,\\nBut swift of foot, and matchless in the race.\\n“Hector! (he said) my courage bids me meet\\nThis high achievement, and explore the fleet:\\nBut first exalt thy sceptre to the skies,\\nAnd swear to grant me the demanded prize;\\nThe immortal coursers, and the glittering car,\\nThat bear Pelides through the ranks of war.\\nEncouraged thus, no idle scout I go,\\nFulfil thy wish, their whole intention know,\\nEven to the royal tent pursue my way,\\nAnd all their counsels, all their aims betray.”\\n\\nThe chief then heaved the golden sceptre high,\\nAttesting thus the monarch of the sky:\\n“Be witness thou! immortal lord of all!\\nWhose thunder shakes the dark aerial hall:\\nBy none but Dolon shall this prize be borne,\\nAnd him alone the immortal steeds adorn.”\\n\\nThus Hector swore: the gods were call’d in vain,\\nBut the rash youth prepares to scour the plain:\\nAcross his back the bended bow he flung,\\nA wolf’s grey hide around his shoulders hung,\\nA ferret’s downy fur his helmet lined,\\nAnd in his hand a pointed javelin shined.\\nThen (never to return) he sought the shore,\\nAnd trod the path his feet must tread no more.\\nScarce had he pass’d the steeds and Trojan throng,\\n(Still bending forward as he coursed along,)\\nWhen, on the hollow way, the approaching tread\\nUlysses mark’d, and thus to Diomed;\\n\\n“O friend! I hear some step of hostile feet,\\nMoving this way, or hastening to the fleet;\\nSome spy, perhaps, to lurk beside the main;\\nOr nightly pillager that strips the slain.\\nYet let him pass, and win a little space;\\nThen rush behind him, and prevent his pace.\\nBut if too swift of foot he flies before,\\nConfine his course along the fleet and shore,\\nBetwixt the camp and him our spears employ,\\nAnd intercept his hoped return to Troy.”\\n\\nWith that they stepp’d aside, and stoop’d their head,\\n(As Dolon pass’d,) behind a heap of dead:\\nAlong the path the spy unwary flew;\\nSoft, at just distance, both the chiefs pursue.\\nSo distant they, and such the space between,\\nAs when two teams of mules divide the green,\\n(To whom the hind like shares of land allows,)\\nWhen now new furrows part the approaching ploughs.\\nNow Dolon, listening, heard them as they pass’d;\\nHector (he thought) had sent, and check’d his haste,\\nTill scarce at distance of a javelin’s throw,\\nNo voice succeeding, he perceived the foe.\\nAs when two skilful hounds the leveret wind;\\nOr chase through woods obscure the trembling hind;\\nNow lost, now seen, they intercept his way,\\nAnd from the herd still turn the flying prey:\\nSo fast, and with such fears, the Trojan flew;\\nSo close, so constant, the bold Greeks pursue.\\nNow almost on the fleet the dastard falls,\\nAnd mingles with the guards that watch the walls;\\nWhen brave Tydides stopp’d; a gen’rous thought\\n(Inspired by Pallas) in his bosom wrought,\\nLest on the foe some forward Greek advance,\\nAnd snatch the glory from his lifted lance.\\nThen thus aloud: “Whoe’er thou art, remain;\\nThis javelin else shall fix thee to the plain.”\\nHe said, and high in air the weapon cast,\\nWhich wilful err’d, and o’er his shoulder pass’d;\\nThen fix’d in earth. Against the trembling wood\\nThe wretch stood propp’d, and quiver’d as he stood;\\nA sudden palsy seized his turning head;\\nHis loose teeth chatter’d, and his colour fled;\\nThe panting warriors seize him as he stands,\\nAnd with unmanly tears his life demands.\\n\\n“O spare my youth, and for the breath I owe,\\nLarge gifts of price my father shall bestow:\\nVast heaps of brass shall in your ships be told,\\nAnd steel well-temper’d and refulgent gold.”\\n\\nTo whom Ulysses made this wise reply:\\n“Whoe’er thou art, be bold, nor fear to die.\\nWhat moves thee, say, when sleep has closed the sight,\\nTo roam the silent fields in dead of night?\\nCam’st thou the secrets of our camp to find,\\nBy Hector prompted, or thy daring mind?\\nOr art some wretch by hopes of plunder led,\\nThrough heaps of carnage, to despoil the dead?”\\n\\nThen thus pale Dolon, with a fearful look:\\n(Still, as he spoke, his limbs with horror shook:)\\n“Hither I came, by Hector’s words deceived;\\nMuch did he promise, rashly I believed:\\nNo less a bribe than great Achilles’ car,\\nAnd those swift steeds that sweep the ranks of war,\\nUrged me, unwilling, this attempt to make;\\nTo learn what counsels, what resolves you take:\\nIf now subdued, you fix your hopes on flight,\\nAnd, tired with toils, neglect the watch of night.”\\n\\n“Bold was thy aim, and glorious was the prize,\\n(Ulysses, with a scornful smile, replies,)\\nFar other rulers those proud steeds demand,\\nAnd scorn the guidance of a vulgar hand;\\nEven great Achilles scarce their rage can tame,\\nAchilles sprung from an immortal dame.\\nBut say, be faithful, and the truth recite!\\nWhere lies encamp’d the Trojan chief to-night?\\nWhere stand his coursers? in what quarter sleep\\nTheir other princes? tell what watch they keep:\\nSay, since this conquest, what their counsels are;\\nOr here to combat, from their city far,\\nOr back to Ilion’s walls transfer the war?”\\n\\nUlysses thus, and thus Eumedes’ son:\\n“What Dolon knows, his faithful tongue shall own.\\nHector, the peers assembling in his tent,\\nA council holds at Ilus’ monument.\\nNo certain guards the nightly watch partake;\\nWhere’er yon fires ascend, the Trojans wake:\\nAnxious for Troy, the guard the natives keep;\\nSafe in their cares, the auxiliar forces sleep,\\nWhose wives and infants, from the danger far,\\nDischarge their souls of half the fears of war.”\\n\\n“Then sleep those aids among the Trojan train,\\n(Inquired the chief,) or scattered o’er the plain?”\\nTo whom the spy: “Their powers they thus dispose\\nThe Paeons, dreadful with their bended bows,\\nThe Carians, Caucons, the Pelasgian host,\\nAnd Leleges, encamp along the coast.\\nNot distant far, lie higher on the land\\nThe Lycian, Mysian, and Mæonian band,\\nAnd Phrygia’s horse, by Thymbras’ ancient wall;\\nThe Thracians utmost, and apart from all.\\nThese Troy but lately to her succour won,\\nLed on by Rhesus, great Eioneus’ son:\\nI saw his coursers in proud triumph go,\\nSwift as the wind, and white as winter-snow;\\nRich silver plates his shining car infold;\\nHis solid arms, refulgent, flame with gold;\\nNo mortal shoulders suit the glorious load,\\nCelestial panoply, to grace a god!\\nLet me, unhappy, to your fleet be borne,\\nOr leave me here, a captive’s fate to mourn,\\nIn cruel chains, till your return reveal\\nThe truth or falsehood of the news I tell.”\\n\\nTo this Tydides, with a gloomy frown:\\n“Think not to live, though all the truth be shown:\\nShall we dismiss thee, in some future strife\\nTo risk more bravely thy now forfeit life?\\nOr that again our camps thou may’st explore?\\nNo—once a traitor, thou betray’st no more.”\\n\\nSternly he spoke, and as the wretch prepared\\nWith humble blandishment to stroke his beard,\\nLike lightning swift the wrathful falchion flew,\\nDivides the neck, and cuts the nerves in two;\\nOne instant snatch’d his trembling soul to hell,\\nThe head, yet speaking, mutter’d as it fell.\\nThe furry helmet from his brow they tear,\\nThe wolf’s grey hide, the unbended bow and spear;\\nThese great Ulysses lifting to the skies,\\nTo favouring Pallas dedicates the prize:\\n\\n“Great queen of arms, receive this hostile spoil,\\nAnd let the Thracian steeds reward our toil;\\nThee, first of all the heavenly host, we praise;\\nO speed our labours, and direct our ways!”\\nThis said, the spoils, with dropping gore defaced,\\nHigh on a spreading tamarisk he placed;\\nThen heap’d with reeds and gathered boughs the plain,\\nTo guide their footsteps to the place again.\\n\\nThrough the still night they cross the devious fields,\\nSlippery with blood, o’er arms and heaps of shields,\\nArriving where the Thracian squadrons lay,\\nAnd eased in sleep the labours of the day.\\nRanged in three lines they view the prostrate band:\\nThe horses yoked beside each warrior stand.\\nTheir arms in order on the ground reclined,\\nThrough the brown shade the fulgid weapons shined:\\nAmidst lay Rhesus, stretch’d in sleep profound,\\nAnd the white steeds behind his chariot bound.\\nThe welcome sight Ulysses first descries,\\nAnd points to Diomed the tempting prize.\\n“The man, the coursers, and the car behold!\\nDescribed by Dolon, with the arms of gold.\\nNow, brave Tydides! now thy courage try,\\nApproach the chariot, and the steeds untie;\\nOr if thy soul aspire to fiercer deeds,\\nUrge thou the slaughter, while I seize the steeds.”\\n\\nPallas (this said) her hero’s bosom warms,\\nBreathed in his heart, and strung his nervous arms;\\nWhere’er he pass’d, a purple stream pursued\\nHis thirsty falchion, fat with hostile blood,\\nBathed all his footsteps, dyed the fields with gore,\\nAnd a low groan remurmur’d through the shore.\\nSo the grim lion, from his nightly den,\\nO’erleaps the fences, and invades the pen,\\nOn sheep or goats, resistless in his way,\\nHe falls, and foaming rends the guardless prey;\\nNor stopp’d the fury of his vengeful hand,\\nTill twelve lay breathless of the Thracian band.\\nUlysses following, as his partner slew,\\nBack by the foot each slaughter’d warrior drew;\\nThe milk-white coursers studious to convey\\nSafe to the ships, he wisely cleared the way:\\nLest the fierce steeds, not yet to battles bred,\\nShould start, and tremble at the heaps of dead.\\nNow twelve despatch’d, the monarch last they found;\\nTydides’ falchion fix’d him to the ground.\\nJust then a deathful dream Minerva sent,\\nA warlike form appear’d before his tent,\\nWhose visionary steel his bosom tore:\\nSo dream’d the monarch, and awaked no more.[218]\\n\\nUlysses now the snowy steeds detains,\\nAnd leads them, fasten’d by the silver reins;\\nThese, with his bow unbent, he lash’d along;\\n(The scourge forgot, on Rhesus’ chariot hung;)\\nThen gave his friend the signal to retire;\\nBut him, new dangers, new achievements fire;\\nDoubtful he stood, or with his reeking blade\\nTo send more heroes to the infernal shade,\\nDrag off the car where Rhesus’ armour lay,\\nOr heave with manly force, and lift away.\\nWhile unresolved the son of Tydeus stands,\\nPallas appears, and thus her chief commands:\\n\\n“Enough, my son; from further slaughter cease,\\nRegard thy safety, and depart in peace;\\nHaste to the ships, the gotten spoils enjoy,\\nNor tempt too far the hostile gods of Troy.”\\n\\nThe voice divine confess’d the martial maid;\\nIn haste he mounted, and her word obey’d;\\nThe coursers fly before Ulysses’ bow,\\nSwift as the wind, and white as winter-snow.\\n\\nNot unobserved they pass’d: the god of light\\nHad watch’d his Troy, and mark’d Minerva’s flight,\\nSaw Tydeus’ son with heavenly succour bless’d,\\nAnd vengeful anger fill’d his sacred breast.\\nSwift to the Trojan camp descends the power,\\nAnd wakes Hippocoon in the morning-hour;\\n(On Rhesus’ side accustom’d to attend,\\nA faithful kinsman, and instructive friend;)\\nHe rose, and saw the field deform’d with blood,\\nAn empty space where late the coursers stood,\\nThe yet-warm Thracians panting on the coast;\\nFor each he wept, but for his Rhesus most:\\nNow while on Rhesus’ name he calls in vain,\\nThe gathering tumult spreads o’er all the plain;\\nOn heaps the Trojans rush, with wild affright,\\nAnd wondering view the slaughters of the night.\\n\\nMeanwhile the chiefs, arriving at the shade\\nWhere late the spoils of Hector’s spy were laid,\\nUlysses stopp’d; to him Tydides bore\\nThe trophy, dropping yet with Dolon’s gore:\\nThen mounts again; again their nimbler feet\\nThe coursers ply, and thunder towards the fleet.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration: ] DIOMED AND ULYSSES RETURNING WITH THE SPOILS OF RHESUS\\n\\n\\nOld Nestor first perceived the approaching sound,\\nBespeaking thus the Grecian peers around:\\n“Methinks the noise of trampling steeds I hear,\\nThickening this way, and gathering on my ear;\\nPerhaps some horses of the Trojan breed\\n(So may, ye gods! my pious hopes succeed)\\nThe great Tydides and Ulysses bear,\\nReturn’d triumphant with this prize of war.\\nYet much I fear (ah, may that fear be vain!)\\nThe chiefs outnumber’d by the Trojan train;\\nPerhaps, even now pursued, they seek the shore;\\nOr, oh! perhaps those heroes are no more.”\\n\\nScarce had he spoke, when, lo! the chiefs appear,\\nAnd spring to earth; the Greeks dismiss their fear:\\nWith words of friendship and extended hands\\nThey greet the kings; and Nestor first demands:\\n\\n“Say thou, whose praises all our host proclaim,\\nThou living glory of the Grecian name!\\nSay whence these coursers? by what chance bestow’d,\\nThe spoil of foes, or present of a god?\\nNot those fair steeds, so radiant and so gay,\\nThat draw the burning chariot of the day.\\nOld as I am, to age I scorn to yield,\\nAnd daily mingle in the martial field;\\nBut sure till now no coursers struck my sight\\nLike these, conspicuous through the ranks of fight.\\nSome god, I deem, conferred the glorious prize,\\nBless’d as ye are, and favourites of the skies;\\nThe care of him who bids the thunder roar,\\nAnd her, whose fury bathes the world with gore.”\\n\\n“Father! not so, (sage Ithacus rejoin’d,)\\nThe gifts of heaven are of a nobler kind.\\nOf Thracian lineage are the steeds ye view,\\nWhose hostile king the brave Tydides slew;\\nSleeping he died, with all his guards around,\\nAnd twelve beside lay gasping on the ground.\\nThese other spoils from conquer’d Dolon came,\\nA wretch, whose swiftness was his only fame;\\nBy Hector sent our forces to explore,\\nHe now lies headless on the sandy shore.”\\n\\nThen o’er the trench the bounding coursers flew;\\nThe joyful Greeks with loud acclaim pursue.\\nStraight to Tydides’ high pavilion borne,\\nThe matchless steeds his ample stalls adorn:\\nThe neighing coursers their new fellows greet,\\nAnd the full racks are heap’d with generous wheat.\\nBut Dolon’s armour, to his ships convey’d,\\nHigh on the painted stern Ulysses laid,\\nA trophy destin’d to the blue-eyed maid.\\n\\nNow from nocturnal sweat and sanguine stain\\nThey cleanse their bodies in the neighb’ring main:\\nThen in the polished bath, refresh’d from toil,\\nTheir joints they supple with dissolving oil,\\nIn due repast indulge the genial hour,\\nAnd first to Pallas the libations pour:\\nThey sit, rejoicing in her aid divine,\\nAnd the crown’d goblet foams with floods of wine.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBOOK XI.\\n\\n\\nARGUMENT\\n\\n\\nTHE THIRD BATTLE, AND THE ACTS OF AGAMEMNON.\\n\\n\\nAgamemnon, having armed himself, leads the Grecians to battle; Hector\\nprepares the Trojans to receive them, while Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva\\ngive the signals of war. Agamemnon bears all before him and Hector is\\ncommanded by Jupiter (who sends Iris for that purpose) to decline the\\nengagement, till the king shall be wounded and retire from the field.\\nHe then makes a great slaughter of the enemy. Ulysses and Diomed put a\\nstop to him for a time but the latter, being wounded by Paris, is\\nobliged to desert his companion, who is encompassed by the Trojans,\\nwounded, and in the utmost danger, till Menelaus and Ajax rescue him.\\nHector comes against Ajax, but that hero alone opposes multitudes, and\\nrallies the Greeks. In the meantime Machaon, in the other wing of the\\narmy, is pierced with an arrow by Paris, and carried from the fight in\\nNestor’s chariot. Achilles (who overlooked the action from his ship)\\nsent Patroclus to inquire which of the Greeks was wounded in that\\nmanner; Nestor entertains him in his tent with an account of the\\naccidents of the day, and a long recital of some former wars which he\\nremembered, tending to put Patroclus upon persuading Achilles to fight\\nfor his countrymen, or at least to permit him to do it, clad in\\nAchilles’ armour. Patroclus, on his return, meets Eurypylus also\\nwounded, and assists him in that distress.\\n    This book opens with the eight-and-twentieth day of the poem, and\\n    the same day, with its various actions and adventures is extended\\n    through the twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth, sixteenth,\\n    seventeenth, and part of the eighteenth books. The scene lies in\\n    the field near the monument of Ilus.\\n\\n\\nThe saffron morn, with early blushes spread,[219]\\nNow rose refulgent from Tithonus’ bed;\\nWith new-born day to gladden mortal sight,\\nAnd gild the courts of heaven with sacred light:\\nWhen baleful Eris, sent by Jove’s command,\\nThe torch of discord blazing in her hand,\\nThrough the red skies her bloody sign extends,\\nAnd, wrapt in tempests, o’er the fleet descends.\\nHigh on Ulysses’ bark her horrid stand\\nShe took, and thunder’d through the seas and land.\\n\\nEven Ajax and Achilles heard the sound,\\nWhose ships, remote, the guarded navy bound,\\nThence the black fury through the Grecian throng\\nWith horror sounds the loud Orthian song:\\nThe navy shakes, and at the dire alarms\\nEach bosom boils, each warrior starts to arms.\\nNo more they sigh, inglorious to return,\\nBut breathe revenge, and for the combat burn.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration: ] THE DESCENT OF DISCORD\\n\\n\\nThe king of men his hardy host inspires\\nWith loud command, with great example fires!\\nHimself first rose, himself before the rest\\nHis mighty limbs in radiant armour dress’d,\\nAnd first he cased his manly legs around\\nIn shining greaves with silver buckles bound;\\nThe beaming cuirass next adorn’d his breast,\\nThe same which once king Cinyras possess’d:\\n(The fame of Greece and her assembled host\\nHad reach’d that monarch on the Cyprian coast;\\n’Twas then, the friendship of the chief to gain,\\nThis glorious gift he sent, nor sent in vain:)\\nTen rows of azure steel the work infold,\\nTwice ten of tin, and twelve of ductile gold;\\nThree glittering dragons to the gorget rise,\\nWhose imitated scales against the skies\\nReflected various light, and arching bow’d,\\nLike colour’d rainbows o’er a showery cloud\\n(Jove’s wondrous bow, of three celestial dies,\\nPlaced as a sign to man amidst the skies).\\nA radiant baldric, o’er his shoulder tied,\\nSustain’d the sword that glitter’d at his side:\\nGold was the hilt, a silver sheath encased\\nThe shining blade, and golden hangers graced.\\nHis buckler’s mighty orb was next display’d,\\nThat round the warrior cast a dreadful shade;\\nTen zones of brass its ample brim surround,\\nAnd twice ten bosses the bright convex crown’d:\\nTremendous Gorgon frown’d upon its field,\\nAnd circling terrors fill’d the expressive shield:\\nWithin its concave hung a silver thong,\\nOn which a mimic serpent creeps along,\\nHis azure length in easy waves extends,\\nTill in three heads the embroider’d monster ends.\\nLast o’er his brows his fourfold helm he placed,\\nWith nodding horse-hair formidably graced;\\nAnd in his hands two steely javelins wields,\\nThat blaze to heaven, and lighten all the fields.\\n\\nThat instant Juno, and the martial maid,\\nIn happy thunders promised Greece their aid;\\nHigh o’er the chief they clash’d their arms in air,\\nAnd, leaning from the clouds, expect the war.\\n\\nClose to the limits of the trench and mound,\\nThe fiery coursers to their chariots bound\\nThe squires restrain’d: the foot, with those who wield\\nThe lighter arms, rush forward to the field.\\nTo second these, in close array combined,\\nThe squadrons spread their sable wings behind.\\nNow shouts and tumults wake the tardy sun,\\nAs with the light the warriors’ toils begun.\\nEven Jove, whose thunder spoke his wrath, distill’d\\nRed drops of blood o’er all the fatal field;[220]\\nThe woes of men unwilling to survey,\\nAnd all the slaughters that must stain the day.\\n\\nNear Ilus’ tomb, in order ranged around,\\nThe Trojan lines possess’d the rising ground:\\nThere wise Polydamas and Hector stood;\\nÆneas, honour’d as a guardian god;\\nBold Polybus, Agenor the divine;\\nThe brother-warriors of Antenor’s line:\\nWith youthful Acamas, whose beauteous face\\nAnd fair proportion match’d the ethereal race.\\nGreat Hector, cover’d with his spacious shield,\\nPlies all the troops, and orders all the field.\\nAs the red star now shows his sanguine fires\\nThrough the dark clouds, and now in night retires,\\nThus through the ranks appear’d the godlike man,\\nPlunged in the rear, or blazing in the van;\\nWhile streamy sparkles, restless as he flies,\\nFlash from his arms, as lightning from the skies.\\nAs sweating reapers in some wealthy field,\\nRanged in two bands, their crooked weapons wield,\\nBear down the furrows, till their labours meet;\\nThick fall the heapy harvests at their feet:\\nSo Greece and Troy the field of war divide,\\nAnd falling ranks are strow’d on every side.\\nNone stoop’d a thought to base inglorious flight;[221]\\nBut horse to horse, and man to man they fight,\\nNot rabid wolves more fierce contest their prey;\\nEach wounds, each bleeds, but none resign the day.\\nDiscord with joy the scene of death descries,\\nAnd drinks large slaughter at her sanguine eyes:\\nDiscord alone, of all the immortal train,\\nSwells the red horrors of this direful plain:\\nThe gods in peace their golden mansions fill,\\nRanged in bright order on the Olympian hill:\\nBut general murmurs told their griefs above,\\nAnd each accused the partial will of Jove.\\nMeanwhile apart, superior, and alone,\\nThe eternal Monarch, on his awful throne,\\nWrapt in the blaze of boundless glory sate;\\nAnd fix’d, fulfill’d the just decrees of fate.\\nOn earth he turn’d his all-considering eyes,\\nAnd mark’d the spot where Ilion’s towers arise;\\nThe sea with ships, the fields with armies spread,\\nThe victor’s rage, the dying, and the dead.\\n\\nThus while the morning-beams, increasing bright,\\nO’er heaven’s pure azure spread the glowing light,\\nCommutual death the fate of war confounds,\\nEach adverse battle gored with equal wounds.\\nBut now (what time in some sequester’d vale\\nThe weary woodman spreads his sparing meal,\\nWhen his tired arms refuse the axe to rear,\\nAnd claim a respite from the sylvan war;\\nBut not till half the prostrate forests lay\\nStretch’d in long ruin, and exposed to day)\\nThen, nor till then, the Greeks’ impulsive might\\nPierced the black phalanx, and let in the light.\\nGreat Agamemnon then the slaughter led,\\nAnd slew Bienor at his people’s head:\\nWhose squire Oïleus, with a sudden spring,\\nLeap’d from the chariot to revenge his king;\\nBut in his front he felt the fatal wound,\\nWhich pierced his brain, and stretch’d him on the ground.\\nAtrides spoil’d, and left them on the plain:\\nVain was their youth, their glittering armour vain:\\nNow soil’d with dust, and naked to the sky,\\nTheir snowy limbs and beauteous bodies lie.\\n\\nTwo sons of Priam next to battle move,\\nThe product, one of marriage, one of love:[222]\\nIn the same car the brother-warriors ride;\\nThis took the charge to combat, that to guide:\\nFar other task, than when they wont to keep,\\nOn Ida’s tops, their father’s fleecy sheep.\\nThese on the mountains once Achilles found,\\nAnd captive led, with pliant osiers bound;\\nThen to their sire for ample sums restored;\\nBut now to perish by Atrides’ sword:\\nPierced in the breast the base-born Isus bleeds:\\nCleft through the head his brother’s fate succeeds,\\nSwift to the spoil the hasty victor falls,\\nAnd, stript, their features to his mind recalls.\\nThe Trojans see the youths untimely die,\\nBut helpless tremble for themselves, and fly.\\nSo when a lion ranging o’er the lawns,\\nFinds, on some grassy lair, the couching fawns,\\nTheir bones he cracks, their reeking vitals draws,\\nAnd grinds the quivering flesh with bloody jaws;\\nThe frighted hind beholds, and dares not stay,\\nBut swift through rustling thickets bursts her way;\\nAll drown’d in sweat, the panting mother flies,\\nAnd the big tears roll trickling from her eyes.\\n\\nAmidst the tumult of the routed train,\\nThe sons of false Antimachus were slain;\\nHe who for bribes his faithless counsels sold,\\nAnd voted Helen’s stay for Paris’ gold.\\nAtrides mark’d, as these their safety sought,\\nAnd slew the children for the father’s fault;\\nTheir headstrong horse unable to restrain,\\nThey shook with fear, and dropp’d the silken rein;\\nThen in the chariot on their knees they fall,\\nAnd thus with lifted hands for mercy call:\\n\\n“O spare our youth, and for the life we owe,\\nAntimachus shall copious gifts bestow:\\nSoon as he hears, that, not in battle slain,\\nThe Grecian ships his captive sons detain,\\nLarge heaps of brass in ransom shall be told,\\nAnd steel well-tempered, and persuasive gold.”\\n\\nThese words, attended with the flood of tears,\\nThe youths address’d to unrelenting ears:\\nThe vengeful monarch gave this stern reply:\\n“If from Antimachus ye spring, ye die;\\nThe daring wretch who once in council stood\\nTo shed Ulysses’ and my brother’s blood,\\nFor proffer’d peace! and sues his seed for grace?\\nNo, die, and pay the forfeit of your race.”\\n\\nThis said, Pisander from the car he cast,\\nAnd pierced his breast: supine he breathed his last.\\nHis brother leap’d to earth; but, as he lay,\\nThe trenchant falchion lopp’d his hands away;\\nHis sever’d head was toss’d among the throng,\\nAnd, rolling, drew a bloody train along.\\nThen, where the thickest fought, the victor flew;\\nThe king’s example all his Greeks pursue.\\nNow by the foot the flying foot were slain,\\nHorse trod by horse, lay foaming on the plain.\\nFrom the dry fields thick clouds of dust arise,\\nShade the black host, and intercept the skies.\\nThe brass-hoof’d steeds tumultuous plunge and bound,\\nAnd the thick thunder beats the labouring ground,\\nStill slaughtering on, the king of men proceeds;\\nThe distanced army wonders at his deeds,\\nAs when the winds with raging flames conspire,\\nAnd o’er the forests roll the flood of fire,\\nIn blazing heaps the grove’s old honours fall,\\nAnd one refulgent ruin levels all:\\nBefore Atrides’ rage so sinks the foe,\\nWhole squadrons vanish, and proud heads lie low.\\nThe steeds fly trembling from his waving sword,\\nAnd many a car, now lighted of its lord,\\nWide o’er the field with guideless fury rolls,\\nBreaking their ranks, and crushing out their souls;\\nWhile his keen falchion drinks the warriors’ lives;\\nMore grateful, now, to vultures than their wives!\\n\\nPerhaps great Hector then had found his fate,\\nBut Jove and destiny prolong’d his date.\\nSafe from the darts, the care of heaven he stood,\\nAmidst alarms, and death, and dust, and blood.\\n\\nNow past the tomb where ancient Ilus lay,\\nThrough the mid field the routed urge their way:\\nWhere the wild figs the adjoining summit crown,\\nThe path they take, and speed to reach the town.\\nAs swift, Atrides with loud shouts pursued,\\nHot with his toil, and bathed in hostile blood.\\nNow near the beech-tree, and the Scæan gates,\\nThe hero halts, and his associates waits.\\nMeanwhile on every side around the plain,\\nDispersed, disorder’d, fly the Trojan train.\\nSo flies a herd of beeves, that hear dismay’d\\nThe lion’s roaring through the midnight shade;\\nOn heaps they tumble with successless haste;\\nThe savage seizes, draws, and rends the last.\\nNot with less fury stern Atrides flew,\\nStill press’d the rout, and still the hindmost slew;\\nHurl’d from their cars the bravest chiefs are kill’d,\\nAnd rage, and death, and carnage load the field.\\n\\nNow storms the victor at the Trojan wall;\\nSurveys the towers, and meditates their fall.\\nBut Jove descending shook the Idaean hills,\\nAnd down their summits pour’d a hundred rills:\\nThe unkindled lightning in his hand he took,\\nAnd thus the many-coloured maid bespoke:\\n\\n“Iris, with haste thy golden wings display,\\nTo godlike Hector this our word convey—\\nWhile Agamemnon wastes the ranks around,\\nFights in the front, and bathes with blood the ground,\\nBid him give way; but issue forth commands,\\nAnd trust the war to less important hands:\\nBut when, or wounded by the spear or dart,\\nThat chief shall mount his chariot, and depart,\\nThen Jove shall string his arm, and fire his breast,\\nThen to her ships shall flying Greece be press’d,\\nTill to the main the burning sun descend,\\nAnd sacred night her awful shade extend.”\\n\\nHe spoke, and Iris at his word obey’d;\\nOn wings of winds descends the various maid.\\nThe chief she found amidst the ranks of war,\\nClose to the bulwarks, on his glittering car.\\nThe goddess then: “O son of Priam, hear!\\nFrom Jove I come, and his high mandate bear.\\nWhile Agamemnon wastes the ranks around,\\nFights in the front, and bathes with blood the ground,\\nAbstain from fight; yet issue forth commands,\\nAnd trust the war to less important hands:\\nBut when, or wounded by the spear or dart,\\nThe chief shall mount his chariot, and depart,\\nThen Jove shall string thy arm, and fire thy breast,\\nThen to her ships shall flying Greece be press’d,\\nTill to the main the burning sun descend,\\nAnd sacred night her awful shade extend.”\\n\\nShe said, and vanish’d. Hector, with a bound,\\nSprings from his chariot on the trembling ground,\\nIn clanging arms: he grasps in either hand\\nA pointed lance, and speeds from band to band;\\nRevives their ardour, turns their steps from flight,\\nAnd wakes anew the dying flames of fight.\\nThey stand to arms: the Greeks their onset dare,\\nCondense their powers, and wait the coming war.\\nNew force, new spirit, to each breast returns;\\nThe fight renew’d with fiercer fury burns:\\nThe king leads on: all fix on him their eye,\\nAnd learn from him to conquer, or to die.\\n\\nYe sacred nine! celestial Muses! tell,\\nWho faced him first, and by his prowess fell?\\nThe great Iphidamas, the bold and young,\\nFrom sage Antenor and Theano sprung;\\nWhom from his youth his grandsire Cisseus bred,\\nAnd nursed in Thrace where snowy flocks are fed.\\nScarce did the down his rosy cheeks invest,\\nAnd early honour warm his generous breast,\\nWhen the kind sire consign’d his daughter’s charms\\n(Theano’s sister) to his youthful arms.\\nBut call’d by glory to the wars of Troy,\\nHe leaves untasted the first fruits of joy;\\nFrom his loved bride departs with melting eyes,\\nAnd swift to aid his dearer country flies.\\nWith twelve black ships he reach’d Percope’s strand,\\nThence took the long laborious march by land.\\nNow fierce for fame, before the ranks he springs,\\nTowering in arms, and braves the king of kings.\\nAtrides first discharged the missive spear;\\nThe Trojan stoop’d, the javelin pass’d in air.\\nThen near the corslet, at the monarch’s heart,\\nWith all his strength, the youth directs his dart:\\nBut the broad belt, with plates of silver bound,\\nThe point rebated, and repell’d the wound.\\nEncumber’d with the dart, Atrides stands,\\nTill, grasp’d with force, he wrench’d it from his hands;\\nAt once his weighty sword discharged a wound\\nFull on his neck, that fell’d him to the ground.\\nStretch’d in the dust the unhappy warrior lies,\\nAnd sleep eternal seals his swimming eyes.\\nOh worthy better fate! oh early slain!\\nThy country’s friend; and virtuous, though in vain!\\nNo more the youth shall join his consort’s side,\\nAt once a virgin, and at once a bride!\\nNo more with presents her embraces meet,\\nOr lay the spoils of conquest at her feet,\\nOn whom his passion, lavish of his store,\\nBestow’d so much, and vainly promised more!\\nUnwept, uncover’d, on the plain he lay,\\nWhile the proud victor bore his arms away.\\n\\nCoon, Antenor’s eldest hope, was nigh:\\nTears, at the sight, came starting from his eye,\\nWhile pierced with grief the much-loved youth he view’d,\\nAnd the pale features now deform’d with blood.\\nThen, with his spear, unseen, his time he took,\\nAim’d at the king, and near his elbow strook.\\nThe thrilling steel transpierced the brawny part,\\nAnd through his arm stood forth the barbed dart.\\nSurprised the monarch feels, yet void of fear\\nOn Coon rushes with his lifted spear:\\nHis brother’s corpse the pious Trojan draws,\\nAnd calls his country to assert his cause;\\nDefends him breathless on the sanguine field,\\nAnd o’er the body spreads his ample shield.\\nAtrides, marking an unguarded part,\\nTransfix’d the warrior with his brazen dart;\\nProne on his brother’s bleeding breast he lay,\\nThe monarch’s falchion lopp’d his head away:\\nThe social shades the same dark journey go,\\nAnd join each other in the realms below.\\n\\nThe vengeful victor rages round the fields,\\nWith every weapon art or fury yields:\\nBy the long lance, the sword, or ponderous stone,\\nWhole ranks are broken, and whole troops o’erthrown.\\nThis, while yet warm distill’d the purple flood;\\nBut when the wound grew stiff with clotted blood,\\nThen grinding tortures his strong bosom rend,\\nLess keen those darts the fierce Ilythiae send:\\n(The powers that cause the teeming matron’s throes,\\nSad mothers of unutterable woes!)\\nStung with the smart, all-panting with the pain,\\nHe mounts the car, and gives his squire the rein;\\nThen with a voice which fury made more strong,\\nAnd pain augmented, thus exhorts the throng:\\n\\n“O friends!

The\\nAjaces form their troops in a close phalanx, and put a stop to Hector\\nand the Trojans. Several deeds of valour are performed; Meriones,\\nlosing his spear in the encounter, repairs to seek another at the tent\\nof Idomeneus: this occasions a conversation between those two warriors,\\nwho return together to the battle. Idomeneus signalizes his courage\\nabove the rest; he kills Othryoneus, Asius, and Alcathous: Deiphobus\\nand Æneas march against him, and at length Idomeneus retires. Menelaus\\nwounds Helenus, and kills Pisander. The Trojans are repulsed on the\\nleft wing; Hector still keeps his ground against the Ajaces, till,\\nbeing galled by the Locrian slingers and archers, Polydamas advises to\\ncall a council of war: Hector approves of his advice, but goes first to\\nrally the Trojans; upbraids Paris, rejoins Polydamas, meets Ajax again,\\nand renews the attack.\\n    The eight-and-twentieth day still continues.

mind;\\nTheir guardians these, the nations round confess,\\nAnd towns and empires for their safety bless.\\nIf Heaven have lodged this virtue in my breast,\\nAttend, O Hector! what I judge the best,\\nSee, as thou mov’st, on dangers dangers spread,\\nAnd war’s whole fury burns around thy head.\\nBehold! distress’d within yon hostile wall,\\nHow many Trojans yield, disperse, or fall!\\nWhat troops, out-number’d, scarce the war maintain!\\nAnd what brave heroes at the ships lie slain!\\nHere cease thy fury: and, the chiefs and kings\\nConvoked to council, weigh the sum of things.\\nWhether (the gods succeeding our desires)\\nTo yon tall ships to bear the Trojan fires;\\nOr quit the fleet, and pass unhurt away,\\nContented with the conquest of the day.\\nI fear, I fear, lest Greece, not yet undone,\\nPay the large debt of last revolving sun;\\nAchilles, great Achilles, yet remains\\nOn yonder decks, and yet o’erlooks the plains!”\\n\\nThe counsel pleased; and Hector, with a bound,\\nLeap’d from his chariot on the trembling ground;\\nSwift as he leap’d his clanging arms resound.\\n“To guard this post (he cried) thy art employ,\\nAnd here detain the scatter’d youth of Troy;\\nWhere yonder heroes faint, I bend my way,\\nAnd hasten back to end the doubtful day.”\\n\\nThis said, the towering chief prepares to go,\\nShakes his white plumes that to the breezes

the bold leaders of the Trojan band:\\nBut round the battlements, and round the plain,\\nFor many a chief he look’d, but look’d in vain;\\nDeiphobus, nor Helenus the seer,\\nNor Asius’ son, nor Asius’ self appear:\\nFor these were pierced with many a ghastly wound,\\nSome cold in death, some groaning on the ground;\\nSome low in dust, (a mournful object) lay;\\nHigh on the wall some breathed their souls away.\\n\\nFar on the left, amid the throng he found\\n(Cheering the troops, and dealing deaths around)\\nThe graceful Paris; whom, with fury moved,\\nOpprobrious thus, th’ impatient chief reproved:\\n\\n“Ill-fated Paris! slave to womankind,\\nAs smooth of face as fraudulent of mind!\\nWhere is Deiphobus, where Asius gone?\\nThe godlike father, and th’ intrepid son?\\nThe force of Helenus, dispensing fate;\\nAnd great Othryoneus, so fear’d of late?\\nBlack fate hang’s o’er thee from th’ avenging gods,\\nImperial Troy from her foundations nods;\\nWhelm’d in thy country’s ruin shalt thou fall,\\nAnd one devouring vengeance swallow all.”\\n\\nWhen Paris thus: “My brother and my friend,\\nThy warm impatience makes thy tongue offend,\\nIn other battles I deserved thy blame,\\nThough then not deedless, nor unknown to fame:\\nBut since yon rampart by thy arms lay low,\\nI scatter’d slaughter from my fatal bow.\\nThe chiefs you seek on yonder shore lie slain;\\nOf all those heroes, two alone remain;\\nDeiphobus, and Helenus the seer,\\nEach now disabled by a hostile spear.\\nGo then, successful, where thy soul inspires:\\nThis heart and hand shall second all thy fires:\\nWhat with this arm I can, prepare to know,\\nTill death for death be paid, and blow for blow.\\nBut ’tis not ours, with forces not our own\\nTo combat: strength is of the gods alone.”\\nThese words the hero’s angry mind assuage:\\nThen fierce they mingle where the thickest rage.\\nAround Polydamas, distain’d with blood,\\nCebrion, Phalces, stern Orthaeus stood,\\nPalmus, with Polypœtes the divine,\\nAnd two bold brothers of Hippotion’s line\\n(Who reach’d fair Ilion, from Ascania far,\\nThe former day; the next engaged in war).\\nAs when from gloomy clouds a whirlwind

Agamemnon proposes to make their escape by\\nnight, which Ulysses withstands; to which Diomed adds his advice, that,\\nwounded as they were, they should go forth and encourage the army with\\ntheir presence, which advice is pursued. Juno, seeing the partiality of\\nJupiter to the Trojans, forms a design to over-reach him: she sets off\\nher charms with the utmost care, and (the more surely to enchant him)\\nobtains the magic girdle of Venus. She then applies herself to the god\\nof sleep, and, with some difficulty, persuades him to seal the eyes of\\nJupiter: this done, she goes to mount Ida, where the god, at first\\nsight, is ravished with her beauty, sinks in her embraces, and is laid\\nasleep. Neptune takes advantage of his slumber, and succours the\\nGreeks: Hector is struck to the ground with a prodigious stone by Ajax,\\nand carried off from the battle: several actions succeed, till the\\nTrojans, much distressed, are obliged to give way: the lesser Ajax\\nsignalizes himself in a particular manner.\\n\\n\\nBut not the genial feast, nor flowing bowl,\\nCould charm the cares of Nestor’s watchful soul;\\nHis startled ears the increasing cries attend;\\nThen thus, impatient, to his wounded friend:\\n\\n“What new alarm, divine Machaon, say,\\nWhat mix’d events attend this mighty day?\\nHark! how the shouts divide, and how they meet,\\nAnd now come full, and thicken to the fleet!\\nHere with the cordial draught dispel thy care,\\nLet Hecamede the strengthening bath prepare,\\nRefresh thy wound, and cleanse the clotted gore;\\nWhile I the adventures of the day explore.”\\n\\nHe said: and, seizing Thrasymedes’ shield,\\n(His valiant offspring,) hasten’d to the field;\\n(That day the son his father’s buckler bore;)\\nThen snatch’d a lance, and issued from the door.\\nSoon as the prospect open’d to his view,\\nHis wounded eyes the scene of sorrow knew;\\nDire disarray! the tumult of the fight,\\nThe wall in ruins, and the Greeks in flight.\\nAs when old ocean’s silent surface sleeps,\\nThe waves just heaving on the purple deeps:\\nWhile yet the expected tempest hangs on high,\\nWeighs down the cloud, and blackens in the sky,\\nThe mass of waters will no wind obey;\\nJove sends one gust, and bids them roll away.\\nWhile wavering counsels thus his mind engage,\\nFluctuates in doubtful thought the Pylian sage,\\nTo join the host, or to the general haste;\\nDebating long, he fixes on the last:\\nYet, as he moves, the sight his bosom warms,\\nThe field rings dreadful with the clang of arms,\\nThe gleaming falchions flash, the javelins fly;\\nBlows echo blows, and all or kill or die.\\n\\nHim, in his march, the wounded princes meet,\\nBy tardy steps ascending from the fleet:\\nThe king of men, Ulysses the divine,\\nAnd who to Tydeus owes his noble line[232]\\n(Their ships at distance from the battle stand,\\nIn lines advanced along the shelving strand:\\nWhose bay, the fleet unable to contain\\nAt length; beside the margin of the main,\\nRank above rank, the crowded ships they moor:\\nWho landed first, lay highest on the shore.)\\nSupported on the spears, they took their way,\\nUnfit to fight, but anxious for the day.\\nNestor’s approach alarm’d each Grecian breast,\\nWhom thus the general of the host address’d:\\n\\n“O grace and glory of the Achaian name;\\nWhat drives thee, Nestor, from the field of fame?\\nShall then proud Hector see his boast fulfill’d,\\nOur fleets in ashes, and our heroes kill’d?\\nSuch was his threat, ah! now too soon made good,\\nOn many a Grecian bosom writ in blood.\\nIs every heart inflamed with equal rage\\nAgainst your king, nor will one chief engage?\\nAnd have I lived to see with mournful eyes\\nIn every Greek a new Achilles rise?”\\n\\nGerenian Nestor then: “So fate has will’d;\\nAnd all-confirming time has fate fulfill’d.\\nNot he that thunders from the aerial bower,\\nNot Jove himself, upon the past has power.\\nThe wall, our late inviolable bound,\\nAnd best defence, lies smoking on the ground:\\nEven to the ships their conquering arms extend,\\nAnd groans of slaughter’d Greeks to heaven ascend.\\nOn speedy measures then employ your thought\\nIn such distress! if counsel profit aught:\\nArms cannot much: though Mars our souls incite,\\nThese gaping wounds withhold us from the fight.”\\n\\nTo him the monarch: “That our army bends,\\nThat Troy triumphant our high fleet ascends,\\nAnd that the rampart, late our surest trust\\nAnd best defence, lies smoking in the dust;\\nAll this from Jove’s afflictive hand we bear,\\nWho, far from Argos, wills our ruin here.\\nPast are the days when happier Greece was blest,\\nAnd all his favour, all his aid confess’d;\\nNow heaven averse, our hands from battle ties,\\nAnd lifts the Trojan glory to the skies.\\nCease we at length to waste our blood in vain,\\nAnd launch what ships lie nearest to the main;\\nLeave these at anchor, till the coming night:\\nThen, if impetuous Troy forbear the fight,\\nBring all to sea, and hoist each sail for flight.\\nBetter from evils, well foreseen, to run,\\nThan perish in the danger we may shun.”\\n\\nThus he.

Several other particulars of the battle are\\ndescribed; in the heat of which, Patroclus, neglecting the orders of\\nAchilles, pursues the foe to the walls of Troy, where Apollo repulses\\nand disarms him, Euphorbus wounds him, and Hector kills him, which\\nconcludes the book.\\n\\n\\nSo warr’d both armies on the ensanguined shore,\\nWhile the black vessels smoked with human gore.\\nMeantime Patroclus to Achilles flies;\\nThe streaming tears fall copious from his eyes.\\nNot faster, trickling to the plains below,\\nFrom the tall rock the sable waters flow.\\nDivine Pelides, with compassion moved.\\nThus spoke, indulgent, to his best beloved:[243]\\n\\n“Patroclus, say, what grief thy bosom bears,\\nThat flows so fast in these unmanly tears?\\nNo girl, no infant whom the mother keeps\\nFrom her loved breast, with fonder passion weeps;\\nNot more the mother’s soul, that infant warms,\\nClung to her knees, and reaching at her arms,\\nThan thou hast mine!

Hector advancing, Menelaus\\nretires; but soon returns with Ajax, and drives him off. This, Glaucus\\nobjects to Hector as a flight, who thereupon puts on the armour he had\\nwon from Patroclus, and renews the battle. The Greeks give way, till\\nAjax rallies them: Æneas sustains the Trojans. Æneas and Hector attempt\\nthe chariot of Achilles, which is borne off by Automedon. The horses of\\nAchilles deplore the loss of Patroclus: Jupiter covers his body with a\\nthick darkness: the noble prayer of Ajax on that occasion. Menelaus\\nsends Antilochus to Achilles, with the news of Patroclus’ death: then\\nreturns to the fight, where, though attacked with the utmost fury, he\\nand Meriones, assisted by the Ajaces, bear off the body to the ships.\\n    The time is the evening of the eight-and-twentieth day. The scene\\n    lies in the fields before Troy.\\n\\n\\nOn the cold earth divine Patroclus spread,\\nLies pierced with wounds among the vulgar dead.\\nGreat Menelaus, touch’d with generous woe,\\nSprings to the front, and guards him from the foe.\\nThus round her new-fallen young the heifer moves,\\nFruit of her throes, and first-born of her loves;\\nAnd anxious (helpless as he lies, and bare)\\nTurns, and re-turns her, with a mother’s care,\\nOpposed to each that near the carcase came,\\nHis broad shield glimmers, and his lances flame.\\n\\nThe son of Panthus, skill’d the dart to send,\\nEyes the dead hero, and insults the friend.\\n“This hand, Atrides, laid Patroclus low;\\nWarrior! desist, nor tempt an equal blow:\\nTo me the spoils my prowess won, resign:\\nDepart with life, and leave the glory mine.”\\n\\nThe Trojan thus: the Spartan monarch burn’d\\nWith generous anguish, and in scorn return’d:\\n“Laugh’st thou not, Jove! from thy superior throne,\\nWhen mortals boast of prowess not their own?\\nNot thus the lion glories in his might,\\nNor panther braves his spotted foe in fight,\\nNor thus the boar (those terrors of the plain;)\\nMan only vaunts his force, and vaunts in vain.\\nBut far the vainest of the boastful kind,\\nThese sons of Panthus vent their haughty mind.\\nYet ’twas but late, beneath my conquering steel\\nThis boaster’s brother, Hyperenor, fell;\\nAgainst our arm which rashly he defied,\\nVain was his vigour, and as vain his pride.\\nThese eyes beheld him on the dust expire,\\nNo more to cheer his spouse, or glad his sire.\\nPresumptuous youth! like his shall be thy doom,\\nGo, wait thy brother to the Stygian gloom;\\nOr, while thou may’st, avoid the threaten’d fate;\\nFools stay to feel it, and are wise too late.”\\n\\nUnmoved, Euphorbus thus: “That action known,\\nCome, for my brother’s blood repay thy own.\\nHis weeping father claims thy destined head,\\nAnd spouse, a widow in her bridal bed.\\nOn these thy conquer’d spoils I shall bestow,\\nTo soothe a consort’s and a parent’s woe.\\nNo longer then defer the glorious strife,\\nLet heaven decide our fortune, fame, and life.”\\n\\nSwift as the word the missile lance he flings;\\nThe well-aim’d weapon on the buckler rings,\\nBut blunted by the brass, innoxious falls.\\nOn Jove the father great Atrides calls,\\nNor flies the javelin from his arm in vain,\\nIt pierced his throat, and bent him to the plain;\\nWide through the neck appears the grisly wound,\\nProne sinks the warrior, and his arms resound.\\nThe shining circlets of his golden hair,\\nWhich even the Graces might be proud to wear,\\nInstarr’d with gems and gold, bestrow the shore,\\nWith dust dishonour’d, and deform’d with gore.\\n\\nAs the young olive, in some sylvan scene,\\nCrown’d by fresh fountains with eternal green,\\nLifts the gay head, in snowy flowerets fair,\\nAnd plays and dances to the gentle air;\\nWhen lo! a whirlwind from high heaven invades\\nThe tender plant, and withers all its shades;\\nIt lies uprooted from its genial bed,\\nA lovely ruin now defaced and dead:\\nThus young, thus beautiful, Euphorbus lay,\\nWhile the fierce Spartan tore his arms away.\\nProud of his deed, and glorious in the prize,\\nAffrighted Troy the towering victor flies:\\nFlies, as before some mountain lion’s ire\\nThe village curs and trembling swains retire,\\nWhen o’er the slaughter’d bull they hear him roar,\\nAnd see his jaws distil with smoking gore:\\nAll pale with fear, at distance scatter’d round,\\nThey shout incessant, and the vales resound.\\n\\nMeanwhile Apollo view’d with envious eyes,\\nAnd urged great Hector to dispute the prize;\\n(In Mentes’ shape, beneath whose martial care\\nThe rough Ciconians learn’d the trade of war;)[247]\\n“Forbear (he cried) with fruitless speed to chase\\nAchilles’ coursers, of ethereal race;\\nThey stoop not, these, to mortal man’s command,\\nOr stoop to none but great Achilles’ hand.\\nToo long amused with a pursuit so vain,\\nTurn, and behold the brave Euphorbus slain;\\nBy Sparta slain!

The raging pair\\nPierced the thick battle, and provoke the war.\\nAlready had stern Hector seized his head,\\nAnd doom’d to Trojan gods the unhappy dead;\\nBut soon as Ajax rear’d his tower-like shield,\\nSprung to his car, and measured back the field,\\nHis train to Troy the radiant armour bear,\\nTo stand a trophy of his fame in war.\\n\\nMeanwhile great Ajax (his broad shield display’d)\\nGuards the dead hero with the dreadful shade;\\nAnd now before, and now behind he stood:\\nThus in the centre of some gloomy wood,\\nWith many a step, the lioness surrounds\\nHer tawny young, beset by men and hounds;\\nElate her heart, and rousing all her powers,\\nDark o’er the fiery balls each hanging eyebrow lours.\\nFast by his side the generous Spartan glows\\nWith great revenge, and feeds his inward woes.\\n\\nBut Glaucus, leader of the Lycian aids,\\nOn Hector frowning, thus his flight upbraids:\\n\\n“Where now in Hector shall we Hector find?\\nA manly form, without a manly mind.\\nIs this, O chief! a hero’s boasted fame?\\nHow vain, without the merit, is the name!\\nSince battle is renounced, thy thoughts employ\\nWhat other methods may preserve thy Troy:\\n’Tis time to try if Ilion’s state can stand\\nBy thee alone, nor ask a foreign hand:\\nMean, empty boast! but shall the Lycians stake\\nTheir lives for you? those Lycians you forsake?\\nWhat from thy thankless arms can we expect?\\nThy friend Sarpedon proves thy base neglect;\\nSay, shall our slaughter’d bodies guard your walls,\\nWhile unreveng’d the great Sarpedon falls?\\nEven where he died for Troy, you left him there,\\nA feast for dogs, and all the fowls of air.\\nOn my command if any Lycian wait,\\nHence let him march, and give up Troy to fate.\\nDid such a spirit as the gods impart\\nImpel one Trojan hand or Trojan heart,\\n(Such as should burn in every soul that draws\\nThe sword for glory, and his country’s cause)\\nEven yet our mutual arms we might employ,\\nAnd drag yon carcase to the walls of Troy.\\nOh! were Patroclus ours, we might obtain\\nSarpedon’s arms and honour’d corse again!\\nGreece with Achilles’ friend should be repaid,\\nAnd thus due honours purchased to his shade.\\nBut words are vain—Let Ajax once appear,\\nAnd Hector trembles and recedes with fear;\\nThou dar’st not meet the terrors of his eye;\\nAnd lo! already thou prepar’st to fly.”\\n\\nThe Trojan chief with fix’d resentment eyed\\nThe Lycian leader, and sedate replied:\\n\\n“Say, is it just, my friend, that Hector’s ear\\nFrom such a warrior such a speech should hear?\\nI deem’d thee once the wisest of thy kind,\\nBut ill this insult suits a prudent mind.\\nI shun great Ajax?

She preserves the\\nbody of his friend from corruption, and commands him to assemble the\\narmy, to declare his resentment at an end. Agamemnon and Achilles are\\nsolemnly reconciled: the speeches, presents, and ceremonies on that\\noccasion. Achilles is with great difficulty persuaded to refrain from\\nthe battle till the troops have refreshed themselves by the advice of\\nUlysses. The presents are conveyed to the tent of Achilles, where\\nBriseïs laments over the body of Patroclus. The hero obstinately\\nrefuses all repast, and gives himself up to lamentations for his\\nfriend. Minerva descends to strengthen him, by the order of Jupiter. He\\narms for the fight: his appearance described. He addresses himself to\\nhis horses, and reproaches them with the death of Patroclus. One of\\nthem is miraculously endued with voice, and inspired to prophesy his\\nfate: but the hero, not astonished by that prodigy, rushes with fury to\\nthe combat.\\n    The thirtieth day.

(he cried,) these glorious arms, that shine\\nWith matchless art, confess the hand divine.\\nNow to the bloody battle let me bend:\\nBut ah! the relics of my slaughter’d friend!\\nIn those wide wounds through which his spirit fled,\\nShall flies, and worms obscene, pollute the dead?”\\n\\n“That unavailing care be laid aside,\\n(The azure goddess to her son replied,)\\nWhole years untouch’d, uninjured shall remain,\\nFresh as in life, the carcase of the slain.\\nBut go, Achilles, as affairs require,\\nBefore the Grecian peers renounce thine ire:\\nThen uncontroll’d in boundless war engage,\\nAnd heaven with strength supply the mighty rage!”\\n\\n\\n[Illustration: ] THETIS BRINGING THE ARMOUR TO ACHILLES\\n\\n\\nThen in the nostrils of the slain she pour’d\\nNectareous drops, and rich ambrosia shower’d\\nO’er all the corse.

Priam is struck at his approach, and tries to persuade his\\nson to re-enter the town. Hecuba joins her entreaties, but in vain.\\nHector consults within himself what measures to take; but at the\\nadvance of Achilles, his resolution fails him, and he flies. Achilles\\npursues him thrice round the walls of Troy. The gods debate concerning\\nthe fate of Hector; at length Minerva descends to the aid of Achilles.\\nShe deludes Hector in the shape of Deiphobus; he stands the combat, and\\nis slain. Achilles drags the dead body at his chariot in the sight of\\nPriam and Hecuba. Their lamentations, tears, and despair. Their cries\\nreach the ears of Andromache, who, ignorant of this, was retired into\\nthe inner part of the palace: she mounts up to the walls, and beholds\\nher dead husband. She swoons at the spectacle. Her excess of grief and\\nlamentation.\\n    The thirtieth day still continues. The scene lies under the walls,\\n    and on the battlements of Troy.\\n\\n\\nThus to their bulwarks, smit with panic fear,\\nThe herded Ilians rush like driven deer:\\nThere safe they wipe the briny drops away,\\nAnd drown in bowls the labours of the day.\\nClose to the walls, advancing o’er the fields\\nBeneath one roof of well-compacted shields,\\nMarch, bending on, the Greeks’ embodied powers,\\nFar stretching in the shade of Trojan towers.\\nGreat Hector singly stay’d: chain’d down by fate\\nThere fix’d he stood before the Scæan gate;\\nStill his bold arms determined to employ,\\nThe guardian still of long-defended Troy.\\n\\nApollo now to tired Achilles turns:\\n(The power confess’d in all his glory burns:)\\n“And what (he cries) has Peleus’ son in view,\\nWith mortal speed a godhead to pursue?\\nFor not to thee to know the gods is given,\\nUnskill’d to trace the latent marks of heaven.\\nWhat boots thee now, that Troy forsook the plain?\\nVain thy past labour, and thy present vain:\\nSafe in their walls are now her troops bestow’d,\\nWhile here thy frantic rage attacks a god.”\\n\\nThe chief incensed—“Too partial god of day!\\nTo check my conquests in the middle way:\\nHow few in Ilion else had refuge found!\\nWhat gasping numbers now had bit the ground!\\nThou robb’st me of a glory justly mine,\\nPowerful of godhead, and of fraud divine:\\nMean fame, alas! for one of heavenly strain,\\nTo cheat a mortal who repines in vain.”\\n\\nThen to the city, terrible and strong,\\nWith high and haughty steps he tower’d along,\\nSo the proud courser, victor of the prize,\\nTo the near goal with double ardour flies.\\nHim, as he blazing shot across the field,\\nThe careful eyes of Priam first beheld.\\nNot half so dreadful rises to the sight,[274]\\nThrough the thick gloom of some tempestuous night,\\nOrion’s dog (the year when autumn weighs),\\nAnd o’er the feebler stars exerts his rays;\\nTerrific glory! for his burning breath\\nTaints the red air with fevers, plagues, and death.\\nSo flamed his fiery mail. Then wept the sage:\\nHe strikes his reverend head, now white with age;\\nHe lifts his wither’d arms; obtests the skies;\\nHe calls his much-loved son with feeble cries:\\nThe son, resolved Achilles’ force to dare,\\nFull at the Scæan gates expects the war;\\nWhile the sad father on the rampart stands,\\nAnd thus adjures him with extended hands:\\n\\n“Ah stay not, stay not! guardless and alone;\\nHector! my loved, my dearest, bravest son!\\nMethinks already I behold thee slain,\\nAnd stretch’d beneath that fury of the plain.\\nImplacable Achilles! might’st thou be\\nTo all the gods no dearer than to me!\\nThee, vultures wild should scatter round the shore,\\nAnd bloody dogs grow fiercer from thy gore.\\nHow many valiant sons I late enjoy’d,\\nValiant in vain! by thy cursed arm destroy’d:\\nOr, worse than slaughtered, sold in distant isles\\nTo shameful bondage, and unworthy toils.\\nTwo, while I speak, my eyes in vain explore,\\nTwo from one mother sprung, my Polydore,\\nAnd loved Lycaon; now perhaps no more!\\nOh! if in yonder hostile camp they live,\\nWhat heaps of gold, what treasures would I give!\\n(Their grandsire’s wealth, by right of birth their own,\\nConsign’d his daughter with Lelegia’s throne:)\\nBut if (which Heaven forbid) already lost,\\nAll pale they wander on the Stygian coast;\\nWhat sorrows then must their sad mother know,\\nWhat anguish I? unutterable woe!\\nYet less that anguish, less to her, to me,\\nLess to all Troy, if not deprived of thee.\\nYet shun Achilles! enter yet the wall;\\nAnd spare thyself, thy father, spare us all!\\nSave thy dear life; or, if a soul so brave\\nNeglect that thought, thy dearer glory save.\\nPity, while yet I live, these silver hairs;\\nWhile yet thy father feels the woes he bears,\\nYet cursed with sense! a wretch, whom in his rage\\n(All trembling on the verge of helpless age)\\nGreat Jove has placed, sad spectacle of pain!\\nThe bitter dregs of fortune’s cup to drain:\\nTo fill with scenes of death his closing eyes,\\nAnd number all his days by miseries!\\nMy heroes slain, my bridal bed o’erturn’d,\\nMy daughters ravish’d, and my city burn’d,\\nMy bleeding infants dash’d against the floor;\\nThese I have yet to see, perhaps yet more!\\nPerhaps even I, reserved by angry fate,\\nThe last sad relic of my ruin’d state,\\n(Dire pomp of sovereign wretchedness!) must fall,\\nAnd stain the pavement of my regal hall;\\nWhere famish’d dogs, late guardians of my door,\\nShall lick their mangled master’s spatter’d gore.\\nYet for my sons I thank ye, gods! ’tis well;\\nWell have they perish’d, for in fight they fell.\\nWho dies in youth and vigour, dies the best,\\nStruck through with wounds, all honest on the breast.\\nBut when the fates, in fulness of their rage,\\nSpurn the hoar head of unresisting age,\\nIn dust the reverend lineaments deform,\\nAnd pour to dogs the life-blood scarcely warm:\\nThis, this is misery! the last, the worse,\\nThat man can feel! man, fated to be cursed!”\\n\\nHe said, and acting what no words could say,\\nRent from his head the silver locks away.\\nWith him the mournful mother bears a part;\\nYet all her sorrows turn not Hector’s heart.\\nThe zone unbraced, her bosom she display’d;\\nAnd thus, fast-falling the salt tears, she said:\\n\\n“Have mercy on me, O my son! revere\\nThe words of age; attend a parent’s prayer!\\nIf ever thee in these fond arms I press’d,\\nOr still’d thy infant clamours at this breast;\\nAh do not thus our helpless years forego,\\nBut, by our walls secured, repel the foe.\\nAgainst his rage if singly thou proceed,\\nShould’st thou, (but Heaven avert it!) should’st thou bleed,\\nNor must thy corse lie honour’d on the bier,\\nNor spouse, nor mother, grace thee with a tear!\\nFar from our pious rites those dear remains\\nMust feast the vultures on the naked plains.”\\n\\nSo they, while down their cheeks the torrents roll;\\nBut fix’d remains the purpose of his soul;\\nResolved he stands, and with a fiery glance\\nExpects the hero’s terrible advance.\\nSo, roll’d up in his den, the swelling snake\\nBeholds the traveller approach the brake;\\nWhen fed with noxious herbs his turgid veins\\nHave gather’d half the poisons of the plains;\\nHe burns, he stiffens with collected ire,\\nAnd his red eyeballs glare with living fire.\\nBeneath a turret, on his shield reclined,\\nHe stood, and question’d thus his mighty mind:[275]\\n\\n“Where lies my way? to enter in the wall?\\nHonour and shame the ungenerous thought recall:\\nShall proud Polydamas before the gate\\nProclaim, his counsels are obey’d too late,\\nWhich timely follow’d but the former night,\\nWhat numbers had been saved by Hector’s flight?\\nThat wise advice rejected with disdain,\\nI feel my folly in my people slain.\\nMethinks my suffering country’s voice I hear,\\nBut most her worthless sons insult my ear,\\nOn my rash courage charge the chance of war,\\nAnd blame those virtues which they cannot share.\\nNo—if I e’er return, return I must\\nGlorious, my country’s terror laid in dust:\\nOr if I perish, let her see me fall\\nIn field at least, and fighting for her wall.\\nAnd yet suppose these measures I forego,\\nApproach unarm’d, and parley with the foe,\\nThe warrior-shield, the helm, and lance, lay down,\\nAnd treat on terms of peace to save the town:\\nThe wife withheld, the treasure ill-detain’d\\n(Cause of the war, and grievance of the land)\\nWith honourable justice to restore:\\nAnd add half Ilion’s yet remaining store,\\nWhich Troy shall, sworn, produce; that injured Greece\\nMay share our wealth, and leave our walls in peace.\\nBut why this thought?

(’tis worthy your debate)\\nWhether to snatch him from impending fate,\\nOr let him bear, by stern Pelides slain,\\n(Good as he is) the lot imposed on man.”\\n\\nThen Pallas thus: “Shall he whose vengeance forms\\nThe forky bolt, and blackens heaven with storms,\\nShall he prolong one Trojan’s forfeit breath?\\nA man, a mortal, pre-ordain’d to death!\\nAnd will no murmurs fill the courts above?\\nNo gods indignant blame their partial Jove?”\\n\\n“Go then (return’d the sire) without delay,\\nExert thy will: I give the Fates their way.”\\nSwift at the mandate pleased Tritonia flies,\\nAnd stoops impetuous from the cleaving skies.\\n\\nAs through the forest, o’er the vale and lawn,\\nThe well-breath’d beagle drives the flying fawn,\\nIn vain he tries the covert of the brakes,\\nOr deep beneath the trembling thicket shakes;\\nSure of the vapour in the tainted dews,\\nThe certain hound his various maze pursues.\\nThus step by step, where’er the Trojan wheel’d,\\nThere swift Achilles compass’d round the field.\\nOft as to reach the Dardan gates he bends,\\nAnd hopes the assistance of his pitying friends,\\n(Whose showering arrows, as he coursed below,\\nFrom the high turrets might oppress the foe,)\\nSo oft Achilles turns him to the plain:\\nHe eyes the city, but he eyes in vain.\\nAs men in slumbers seem with speedy pace,\\nOne to pursue, and one to lead the chase,\\nTheir sinking limbs the fancied course forsake,\\nNor this can fly, nor that can overtake:\\nNo less the labouring heroes pant and strain:\\nWhile that but flies, and this pursues in vain.\\n\\nWhat god, O muse, assisted Hector’s force\\nWith fate itself so long to hold the course?\\nPhœbus it was; who, in his latest hour,\\nEndued his knees with strength, his nerves with power:\\nAnd great Achilles, lest some Greek’s advance\\nShould snatch the glory from his lifted lance,\\nSign’d to the troops to yield his foe the way,\\nAnd leave untouch’d the honours of the day.\\n\\nJove lifts the golden balances, that show\\nThe fates of mortal men, and things below:\\nHere each contending hero’s lot he tries,\\nAnd weighs, with equal hand, their destinies.\\nLow sinks the scale surcharged with Hector’s fate;\\nHeavy with death it sinks, and hell receives the weight.\\n\\nThen Phœbus left him. Fierce Minerva flies\\nTo stern Pelides, and triumphing, cries:\\n“O loved of Jove! this day our labours cease,\\nAnd conquest blazes with full beams on Greece.\\nGreat Hector falls; that Hector famed so far,\\nDrunk with renown, insatiable of war,\\nFalls by thy hand, and mine! nor force, nor flight,\\nShall more avail him, nor his god of light.\\nSee, where in vain he supplicates above,\\nRoll’d at the feet of unrelenting Jove;\\nRest here: myself will lead the Trojan on,\\nAnd urge to meet the fate he cannot shun.”\\n\\nHer voice divine the chief with joyful mind\\nObey’d; and rested, on his lance reclined\\nWhile like Deiphobus the martial dame\\n(Her face, her gesture, and her arms the same),\\nIn show an aid, by hapless Hector’s side\\nApproach’d, and greets him thus with voice belied:\\n\\n“Too long, O Hector! have I borne the sight\\nOf this distress, and sorrow’d in thy flight:\\nIt fits us now a noble stand to make,\\nAnd here, as brothers, equal fates partake.”\\n\\nThen he: “O prince! allied in blood and fame,\\nDearer than all that own a brother’s name;\\nOf all that Hecuba to Priam bore,\\nLong tried, long loved: much loved, but honoured more!\\nSince you, of all our numerous race alone\\nDefend my life, regardless of your own.”\\n\\nAgain the goddess: “Much my father’s prayer,\\nAnd much my mother’s, press’d me to forbear:\\nMy friends embraced my knees, adjured my stay,\\nBut stronger love impell’d, and I obey.\\nCome then, the glorious conflict let us try,\\nLet the steel sparkle, and the javelin fly;\\nOr let us stretch Achilles on the field,\\nOr to his arm our bloody trophies yield.”\\n\\nFraudful she said; then swiftly march’d before:\\nThe Dardan hero shuns his foe no more.\\nSternly they met. The silence Hector broke:\\nHis dreadful plumage nodded as he spoke:\\n\\n“Enough, O son of Peleus!

After\\nthe funeral feast he retires to the sea-shore, where, falling asleep,\\nthe ghost of his friend appears to him, and demands the rites of\\nburial; the next morning the soldiers are sent with mules and waggons\\nto fetch wood for the pyre. The funeral procession, and the offering\\ntheir hair to the dead. Achilles sacrifices several animals, and lastly\\ntwelve Trojan captives, at the pile; then sets fire to it. He pays\\nlibations to the Winds, which (at the instance of Iris) rise, and raise\\nthe flames. When the pile has burned all night, they gather the bones,\\nplace them in an urn of gold, and raise the tomb. Achilles institutes\\nthe funeral games: the chariot-race, the fight of the caestus, the\\nwrestling, the foot-race, the single combat, the discus, the shooting\\nwith arrows, the darting the javelin: the various descriptions of\\nwhich, and the various success of the several antagonists, make the\\ngreatest part of the book.\\n    In this book ends the thirtieth day. The night following, the ghost\\n    of Patroclus appears to Achilles: the one-and-thirtieth day is\\n    employed in felling the timber for the pile: the two-and-thirtieth\\n    in burning it; and the three-and-thirtieth in the games. The scene\\n    is generally on the sea-shore.\\n\\n\\nThus humbled in the dust, the pensive train\\nThrough the sad city mourn’d her hero slain.\\nThe body soil’d with dust, and black with gore,\\nLies on broad Hellespont’s resounding shore.\\nThe Grecians seek their ships, and clear the strand,\\nAll, but the martial Myrmidonian band:\\nThese yet assembled great Achilles holds,\\nAnd the stern purpose of his mind unfolds:\\n\\n“Not yet, my brave companions of the war,\\nRelease your smoking coursers from the car;\\nBut, with his chariot each in order led,\\nPerform due honours to Patroclus dead.\\nEre yet from rest or food we seek relief,\\nSome rites remain, to glut our rage of grief.”\\n\\nThe troops obey’d; and thrice in order led[281]\\n(Achilles first) their coursers round the dead;\\nAnd thrice their sorrows and laments renew;\\nTears bathe their arms, and tears the sands bedew.\\nFor such a warrior Thetis aids their woe,\\nMelts their strong hearts, and bids their eyes to flow.\\nBut chief, Pelides: thick-succeeding sighs\\nBurst from his heart, and torrents from his eyes:\\nHis slaughtering hands, yet red with blood, he laid\\nOn his dead friend’s cold breast, and thus he said:\\n\\n“All hail, Patroclus! let thy honour’d ghost\\nHear, and rejoice on Pluto’s dreary coast;\\nBehold! Achilles’ promise is complete;\\nThe bloody Hector stretch’d before thy feet.\\nLo! to the dogs his carcase I resign;\\nAnd twelve sad victims, of the Trojan line,\\nSacred to vengeance, instant shall expire;\\nTheir lives effused around thy funeral pyre.”\\n\\nGloomy he said, and (horrible to view)\\nBefore the bier the bleeding Hector threw,\\nProne on the dust. The Myrmidons around\\nUnbraced their armour, and the steeds unbound.\\nAll to Achilles’ sable ship repair,\\nFrequent and full, the genial feast to share.\\nNow from the well-fed swine black smokes aspire,\\nThe bristly victims hissing o’er the fire:\\nThe huge ox bellowing falls; with feebler cries\\nExpires the goat; the sheep in silence dies.\\nAround the hero’s prostrate body flow’d,\\nIn one promiscuous stream, the reeking blood.\\nAnd now a band of Argive monarchs brings\\nThe glorious victor to the king of kings.\\nFrom his dead friend the pensive warrior went,\\nWith steps unwilling, to the regal tent.\\nThe attending heralds, as by office bound,\\nWith kindled flames the tripod-vase surround:\\nTo cleanse his conquering hands from hostile gore,\\nThey urged in vain; the chief refused, and swore:[282]\\n\\n“No drop shall touch me, by almighty Jove!\\nThe first and greatest of the gods above!\\nTill on the pyre I place thee; till I rear\\nThe grassy mound, and clip thy sacred hair.\\nSome ease at least those pious rites may give,\\nAnd soothe my sorrows, while I bear to live.\\nHowe’er, reluctant as I am, I stay\\nAnd share your feast; but with the dawn of day,\\n(O king of men!) it claims thy royal care,\\nThat Greece the warrior’s funeral pile prepare,\\nAnd bid the forests fall: (such rites are paid\\nTo heroes slumbering in eternal shade:)\\nThen, when his earthly part shall mount in fire,\\nLet the leagued squadrons to their posts retire.”\\n\\nHe spoke: they hear him, and the word obey;\\nThe rage of hunger and of thirst allay,\\nThen ease in sleep the labours of the day.\\nBut great Pelides, stretch’d along the shore,\\nWhere, dash’d on rocks, the broken billows roar,\\nLies inly groaning; while on either hand\\nThe martial Myrmidons confusedly stand.\\nAlong the grass his languid members fall,\\nTired with his chase around the Trojan wall;\\nHush’d by the murmurs of the rolling deep,\\nAt length he sinks in the soft arms of sleep.\\nWhen lo! the shade, before his closing eyes,\\nOf sad Patroclus rose, or seem’d to rise:\\nIn the same robe he living wore, he came:\\nIn stature, voice, and pleasing look, the same.\\nThe form familiar hover’d o’er his head,\\n“And sleeps Achilles? (thus the phantom said:)\\nSleeps my Achilles, his Patroclus dead?\\nLiving, I seem’d his dearest, tenderest care,\\nBut now forgot, I wander in the air.\\nLet my pale corse the rites of burial know,\\nAnd give me entrance in the realms below:\\nTill then the spirit finds no resting-place,\\nBut here and there the unbodied spectres chase\\nThe vagrant dead around the dark abode,\\nForbid to cross the irremeable flood.\\nNow give thy hand; for to the farther shore\\nWhen once we pass, the soul returns no more:\\nWhen once the last funereal flames ascend,\\nNo more shall meet Achilles and his friend;\\nNo more our thoughts to those we loved make known;\\nOr quit the dearest, to converse alone.\\nMe fate has sever’d from the sons of earth,\\nThe fate fore-doom’d that waited from my birth:\\nThee too it waits; before the Trojan wall\\nEven great and godlike thou art doom’d to fall.\\nHear then; and as in fate and love we join,\\nAh suffer that my bones may rest with thine!\\nTogether have we lived; together bred,\\nOne house received us, and one table fed;\\nThat golden urn, thy goddess-mother gave,\\nMay mix our ashes in one common grave.”\\n\\n“And is it thou? (he answers) To my sight[283]\\nOnce more return’st thou from the realms of night?\\nO more than brother! Think each office paid,\\nWhate’er can rest a discontented shade;\\nBut grant one last embrace, unhappy boy!\\nAfford at least that melancholy joy.”\\n\\nHe said, and with his longing arms essay’d\\nIn vain to grasp the visionary shade!\\nLike a thin smoke he sees the spirit fly,[284]\\nAnd hears a feeble, lamentable cry.\\nConfused he wakes; amazement breaks the bands\\nOf golden sleep, and starting from the sands,\\nPensive he muses with uplifted hands:\\n\\n“’Tis true, ’tis certain; man, though dead, retains\\nPart of himself; the immortal mind remains:\\nThe form subsists without the body’s aid,\\nAerial semblance, and an empty shade!\\nThis night my friend, so late in battle lost,\\nStood at my side, a pensive, plaintive ghost:\\nEven now familiar, as in life, he came;\\nAlas! how different! yet how like the same!”\\n\\nThus while he spoke, each eye grew big with tears:\\nAnd now the rosy-finger’d morn appears,\\nShows every mournful face with tears o’erspread,\\nAnd glares on the pale visage of the dead.\\nBut Agamemnon, as the rites demand,\\nWith mules and waggons sends a chosen band\\nTo load the timber, and the pile to rear;\\nA charge consign’d to Merion’s faithful care.\\nWith proper instruments they take the road,\\nAxes to cut, and ropes to sling the load.\\nFirst march the heavy mules, securely slow,\\nO’er hills, o’er dales, o’er crags, o’er rocks they go:[285]\\nJumping, high o’er the shrubs of the rough ground,\\nRattle the clattering cars, and the shock’d axles bound.\\nBut when arrived at Ida’s spreading woods,[286]\\n(Fair Ida, water’d with descending floods,)\\nLoud sounds the axe, redoubling strokes on strokes;\\nOn all sides round the forest hurls her oaks\\nHeadlong. Deep echoing groan the thickets brown;\\nThen rustling, crackling, crashing, thunder down.\\nThe wood the Grecians cleave, prepared to burn;\\nAnd the slow mules the same rough road return.\\nThe sturdy woodmen equal burdens bore\\n(Such charge was given them) to the sandy shore;\\nThere on the spot which great Achilles show’d,\\nThey eased their shoulders, and disposed the load;\\nCircling around the place, where times to come\\nShall view Patroclus’ and Achilles’ tomb.\\nThe hero bids his martial troops appear\\nHigh on their cars in all the pomp of war;\\nEach in refulgent arms his limbs attires,\\nAll mount their chariots, combatants and squires.\\nThe chariots first proceed, a shining train;\\nThen clouds of foot that smoke along the plain;\\nNext these the melancholy band appear;\\nAmidst, lay dead Patroclus on the bier;\\nO’er all the corse their scattered locks they throw;\\nAchilles next, oppress’d with mighty woe,\\nSupporting with his hands the hero’s head,\\nBends o’er the extended body of the dead.\\nPatroclus decent on the appointed ground\\nThey place, and heap the sylvan pile around.\\nBut great Achilles stands apart in prayer,\\nAnd from his head divides the yellow hair;\\nThose curling locks which from his youth he vow’d,[287]\\nAnd sacred grew, to Sperchius’ honour’d flood:\\nThen sighing, to the deep his locks he cast,\\nAnd roll’d his eyes around the watery waste:\\n\\n“Sperchius! whose waves in mazy errors lost\\nDelightful roll along my native coast!\\nTo whom we vainly vow’d, at our return,\\nThese locks to fall, and hecatombs to burn:\\nFull fifty rams to bleed in sacrifice,\\nWhere to the day thy silver fountains rise,\\nAnd where in shade of consecrated bowers\\nThy altars stand, perfumed with native flowers!\\nSo vow’d my father, but he vow’d in vain;\\nNo more Achilles sees his native plain;\\nIn that vain hope these hairs no longer grow,\\nPatroclus bears them to the shades below.”\\n\\nThus o’er Patroclus while the hero pray’d,\\nOn his cold hand the sacred lock he laid.\\nOnce more afresh the Grecian sorrows flow:\\nAnd now the sun had set upon their woe;\\nBut to the king of men thus spoke the chief:\\n“Enough, Atrides! give the troops relief:\\nPermit the mourning legions to retire,\\nAnd let the chiefs alone attend the pyre;\\nThe pious care be ours, the dead to burn—”\\nHe said: the people to their ships return:\\nWhile those deputed to inter the slain\\nHeap with a rising pyramid the plain.[288]\\nA hundred foot in length, a hundred wide,\\nThe growing structure spreads on every side;\\nHigh on the top the manly corse they lay,\\nAnd well-fed sheep and sable oxen slay:\\nAchilles covered with their fat the dead,\\nAnd the piled victims round the body spread;\\nThen jars of honey, and of fragrant oil,\\nSuspends around, low-bending o’er the pile.\\nFour sprightly coursers, with a deadly groan\\nPour forth their lives, and on the pyre are thrown.\\nOf nine large dogs, domestic at his board,\\nFall two, selected to attend their lord,\\nThen last of all, and horrible to tell,\\nSad sacrifice! twelve Trojan captives fell.[289]\\nOn these the rage of fire victorious preys,\\nInvolves and joins them in one common blaze.\\nSmear’d with the bloody rites, he stands on high,\\nAnd calls the spirit with a dreadful cry:[290]\\n\\n“All hail, Patroclus! let thy vengeful ghost\\nHear, and exult, on Pluto’s dreary coast.\\nBehold Achilles’ promise fully paid,\\nTwelve Trojan heroes offer’d to thy shade;\\nBut heavier fates on Hector’s corse attend,\\nSaved from the flames, for hungry dogs to rend.”\\n\\nSo spake he, threatening: but the gods made vain\\nHis threat, and guard inviolate the slain:\\nCelestial Venus hover’d o’er his head,\\nAnd roseate unguents, heavenly fragrance! shed:\\nShe watch’d him all the night and all the day,\\nAnd drove the bloodhounds from their destined prey.\\nNor sacred Phœbus less employ’d his care;\\nHe pour’d around a veil of gather’d air,\\nAnd kept the nerves undried, the flesh entire,\\nAgainst the solar beam and Sirian fire.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration: ] THE FUNERAL PILE OF PATROCLUS\\n\\n\\nNor yet the pile, where dead Patroclus lies,\\nSmokes, nor as yet the sullen flames arise;\\nBut, fast beside, Achilles stood in prayer,\\nInvoked the gods whose spirit moves the air,\\nAnd victims promised, and libations cast,\\nTo gentle Zephyr and the Boreal blast:\\nHe call’d the aerial powers, along the skies\\nTo breathe, and whisper to the fires to rise.\\nThe winged Iris heard the hero’s call,\\nAnd instant hasten’d to their airy hall,\\nWhere in old Zephyr’s open courts on high,\\nSat all the blustering brethren of the sky.\\nShe shone amidst them, on her painted bow;\\nThe rocky pavement glitter’d with the show.\\nAll from the banquet rise, and each invites\\nThe various goddess to partake the rites.\\n“Not so (the dame replied), I haste to go\\nTo sacred Ocean, and the floods below:\\nEven now our solemn hecatombs attend,\\nAnd heaven is feasting on the world’s green end\\nWith righteous Ethiops (uncorrupted train!)\\nFar on the extremest limits of the main.\\nBut Peleus’ son entreats, with sacrifice,\\nThe western spirit, and the north, to rise!\\nLet on Patroclus’ pile your blast be driven,\\nAnd bear the blazing honours high to heaven.”\\n\\nSwift as the word she vanish’d from their view;\\nSwift as the word the winds tumultuous flew;\\nForth burst the stormy band with thundering roar,\\nAnd heaps on heaps the clouds are toss’d before.\\nTo the wide main then stooping from the skies,\\nThe heaving deeps in watery mountains rise:\\nTroy feels the blast along her shaking walls,\\nTill on the pile the gather’d tempest falls.\\nThe structure crackles in the roaring fires,\\nAnd all the night the plenteous flame aspires.\\nAll night Achilles hails Patroclus’ soul,\\nWith large libations from the golden bowl.\\nAs a poor father, helpless and undone,\\nMourns o’er the ashes of an only son,\\nTakes a sad pleasure the last bones to burn,\\nAnd pours in tears, ere yet they close the urn:\\nSo stay’d Achilles, circling round the shore,\\nSo watch’d the flames, till now they flame no more.\\n’Twas when, emerging through the shades of night,\\nThe morning planet told the approach of light;\\nAnd, fast behind, Aurora’s warmer ray\\nO’er the broad ocean pour’d the golden day:\\nThen sank the blaze, the pile no longer burn’d,\\nAnd to their caves the whistling winds return’d:\\nAcross the Thracian seas their course they bore;\\nThe ruffled seas beneath their passage roar.\\n\\nThen parting from the pile he ceased to weep,\\nAnd sank to quiet in the embrace of sleep,\\nExhausted with his grief: meanwhile the crowd\\nOf thronging Grecians round Achilles stood;\\nThe tumult waked him: from his eyes he shook\\nUnwilling slumber, and the chiefs bespoke:\\n\\n“Ye kings and princes of the Achaian name!\\nFirst let us quench the yet remaining flame\\nWith sable wine; then, as the rites direct,\\nThe hero’s bones with careful view select:\\n(Apart, and easy to be known they lie\\nAmidst the heap, and obvious to the eye:\\nThe rest around the margin will be seen\\nPromiscuous, steeds and immolated men:)\\nThese wrapp’d in double cauls of fat, prepare;\\nAnd in the golden vase dispose with care;\\nThere let them rest with decent honour laid,\\nTill I shall follow to the infernal shade.\\nMeantime erect the tomb with pious hands,\\nA common structure on the humble sands:\\nHereafter Greece some nobler work may raise,\\nAnd late posterity record our praise!”\\n\\nThe Greeks obey; where yet the embers glow,\\nWide o’er the pile the sable wine they throw,\\nAnd deep subsides the ashy heap below.\\nNext the white bones his sad companions place,\\nWith tears collected, in the golden vase.\\nThe sacred relics to the tent they bore;\\nThe urn a veil of linen covered o’er.\\nThat done, they bid the sepulchre aspire,\\nAnd cast the deep foundations round the pyre;\\nHigh in the midst they heap the swelling bed\\nOf rising earth, memorial of the dead.\\n\\nThe swarming populace the chief detains,\\nAnd leads amidst a wide extent of plains;\\nThere placed them round: then from the ships proceeds\\nA train of oxen, mules, and stately steeds,\\nVases and tripods (for the funeral games),\\nResplendent brass, and more resplendent dames.\\nFirst stood the prizes to reward the force\\nOf rapid racers in the dusty course:\\nA woman for the first, in beauty’s bloom,\\nSkill’d in the needle, and the labouring loom;\\nAnd a large vase, where two bright handles rise,\\nOf twenty measures its capacious size.\\nThe second victor claims a mare unbroke,\\nBig with a mule, unknowing of the yoke:\\nThe third, a charger yet untouch’d by flame;\\nFour ample measures held the shining frame:\\nTwo golden talents for the fourth were placed:\\nAn ample double bowl contents the last.\\nThese in fair order ranged upon the plain,\\nThe hero, rising, thus address’d the train:\\n\\n“Behold the prizes, valiant Greeks! decreed\\nTo the brave rulers of the racing steed;\\nPrizes which none beside ourself could gain,\\nShould our immortal coursers take the plain;\\n(A race unrivall’d, which from ocean’s god\\nPeleus received, and on his son bestow’d.)\\nBut this no time our vigour to display;\\nNor suit, with them, the games of this sad day:\\nLost is Patroclus now, that wont to deck\\nTheir flowing manes, and sleek their glossy neck.\\nSad, as they shared in human grief, they stand,\\nAnd trail those graceful honours on the sand!\\nLet others for the noble task prepare,\\nWho trust the courser and the flying car.”\\n\\nFired at his word the rival racers rise;\\nBut far the first Eumelus hopes the prize,\\nFamed though Pieria for the fleetest breed,\\nAnd skill’d to manage the high-bounding steed.\\nWith equal ardour bold Tydides swell’d,\\nThe steeds of Tros beneath his yoke compell’d\\n(Which late obey’d the Dardan chief’s command,\\nWhen scarce a god redeem’d him from his hand).\\nThen Menelaus his Podargus brings,\\nAnd the famed courser of the king of kings:\\nWhom rich Echepolus (more rich than brave),\\nTo ’scape the wars, to Agamemnon gave,\\n(Æthe her name) at home to end his days;\\nBase wealth preferring to eternal praise.\\nNext him Antilochus demands the course\\nWith beating heart, and cheers his Pylian horse.\\nExperienced Nestor gives his son the reins,\\nDirects his judgment, and his heat restrains;\\nNor idly warns the hoary sire, nor hears\\nThe prudent son with unattending ears.\\n\\n“My son! though youthful ardour fire thy breast,\\nThe gods have loved thee, and with arts have bless’d;\\nNeptune and Jove on thee conferr’d the skill\\nSwift round the goal to turn the flying wheel.\\nTo guide thy conduct little precept needs;\\nBut slow, and past their vigour, are my steeds.\\nFear not thy rivals, though for swiftness known;\\nCompare those rivals’ judgment and thy own:\\nIt is not strength, but art, obtains the prize,\\nAnd to be swift is less than to be wise.\\n’Tis more by art than force of numerous strokes\\nThe dexterous woodman shapes the stubborn oaks;\\nBy art the pilot, through the boiling deep\\nAnd howling tempest, steers the fearless ship;\\nAnd ’tis the artist wins the glorious course;\\nNot those who trust in chariots and in horse.\\nIn vain, unskilful to the goal they strive,\\nAnd short, or wide, the ungovern’d courser drive:\\nWhile with sure skill, though with inferior steeds,\\nThe knowing racer to his end proceeds;\\nFix’d on the goal his eye foreruns the course,\\nHis hand unerring steers the steady horse,\\nAnd now contracts, or now extends the rein,\\nObserving still the foremost on the plain.\\nMark then the goal, ’tis easy to be found;\\nYon aged trunk, a cubit from the ground;\\nOf some once stately oak the last remains,\\nOr hardy fir, unperish’d with the rains:\\nInclosed with stones, conspicuous from afar;\\nAnd round, a circle for the wheeling car.\\n(Some tomb perhaps of old, the dead to grace;\\nOr then, as now, the limit of a race.)\\nBear close to this, and warily proceed,\\nA little bending to the left-hand steed;\\nBut urge the right, and give him all the reins;\\nWhile thy strict hand his fellow’s head restrains,\\nAnd turns him short; till, doubling as they roll,\\nThe wheel’s round naves appear to brush the goal.\\nYet (not to break the car, or lame the horse)\\nClear of the stony heap direct the course;\\nLest through incaution failing, thou mayst be\\nA joy to others, a reproach to me.\\nSo shalt thou pass the goal, secure of mind,\\nAnd leave unskilful swiftness far behind:\\nThough thy fierce rival drove the matchless steed\\nWhich bore Adrastus, of celestial breed;\\nOr the famed race, through all the regions known,\\nThat whirl’d the car of proud Laomedon.”\\n\\nThus (nought unsaid) the much-advising sage\\nConcludes; then sat, stiff with unwieldy age.\\nNext bold Meriones was seen to rise,\\nThe last, but not least ardent for the prize.\\nThey mount their seats; the lots their place dispose\\n(Roll’d in his helmet, these Achilles throws).\\nYoung Nestor leads the race: Eumelus then;\\nAnd next the brother of the king of men:\\nThy lot, Meriones, the fourth was cast;\\nAnd, far the bravest, Diomed, was last.\\nThey stand in order, an impatient train:\\nPelides points the barrier on the plain,\\nAnd sends before old Phœnix to the place,\\nTo mark the racers, and to judge the race.\\nAt once the coursers from the barrier bound;\\nThe lifted scourges all at once resound;\\nTheir heart, their eyes, their voice, they send before;\\nAnd up the champaign thunder from the shore:\\nThick, where they drive, the dusty clouds arise,\\nAnd the lost courser in the whirlwind flies;\\nLoose on their shoulders the long manes reclined,\\nFloat in their speed, and dance upon the wind:\\nThe smoking chariots, rapid as they bound,\\nNow seem to touch the sky, and now the ground.\\nWhile hot for fame, and conquest all their care,\\n(Each o’er his flying courser hung in air,)\\nErect with ardour, poised upon the rein,\\nThey pant, they stretch, they shout along the plain.\\nNow (the last compass fetch’d around the goal)\\nAt the near prize each gathers all his soul,\\nEach burns with double hope, with double pain,\\nTears up the shore, and thunders toward the main.\\nFirst flew Eumelus on Pheretian steeds;\\nWith those of Tros bold Diomed succeeds:\\nClose on Eumelus’ back they puff the wind,\\nAnd seem just mounting on his car behind;\\nFull on his neck he feels the sultry breeze,\\nAnd, hovering o’er, their stretching shadows sees.\\nThen had he lost, or left a doubtful prize;\\nBut angry Phœbus to Tydides flies,\\nStrikes from his hand the scourge, and renders vain\\nHis matchless horses’ labour on the plain.\\nRage fills his eye with anguish, to survey\\nSnatch’d from his hope the glories of the day.\\nThe fraud celestial Pallas sees with pain,\\nSprings to her knight, and gives the scourge again,\\nAnd fills his steeds with vigour. At a stroke\\nShe breaks his rival’s chariot from the yoke:\\nNo more their way the startled horses held;\\nThe car reversed came rattling on the field;\\nShot headlong from his seat, beside the wheel,\\nProne on the dust the unhappy master fell;\\nHis batter’d face and elbows strike the ground;\\nNose, mouth, and front, one undistinguish’d wound:\\nGrief stops his voice, a torrent drowns his eyes:\\nBefore him far the glad Tydides flies;\\nMinerva’s spirit drives his matchless pace,\\nAnd crowns him victor of the labour’d race.\\n\\nThe next, though distant, Menelaus succeeds;\\nWhile thus young Nestor animates his steeds:\\n“Now, now, my generous pair, exert your force;\\nNot that we hope to match Tydides’ horse,\\nSince great Minerva wings their rapid way,\\nAnd gives their lord the honours of the day;\\nBut reach Atrides! shall his mare outgo\\nYour swiftness? vanquish’d by a female foe?\\nThrough your neglect, if lagging on the plain\\nThe last ignoble gift be all we gain,\\nNo more shall Nestor’s hand your food supply,\\nThe old man’s fury rises, and ye die.\\nHaste then: yon narrow road, before our sight,\\nPresents the occasion, could we use it right.”\\n\\nThus he. The coursers at their master’s threat\\nWith quicker steps the sounding champaign beat.\\nAnd now Antilochus with nice survey\\nObserves the compass of the hollow way.\\n’Twas where, by force of wintry torrents torn,\\nFast by the road a precipice was worn:\\nHere, where but one could pass, to shun the throng\\nThe Spartan hero’s chariot smoked along.\\nClose up the venturous youth resolves to keep,\\nStill edging near, and bears him toward the steep.\\nAtrides, trembling, casts his eye below,\\nAnd wonders at the rashness of his foe.\\n“Hold, stay your steeds—What madness thus to ride\\nThis narrow way! take larger field (he cried),\\nOr both must fall.”—Atrides cried in vain;\\nHe flies more fast, and throws up all the rein.\\nFar as an able arm the disk can send,\\nWhen youthful rivals their full force extend,\\nSo far, Antilochus! thy chariot flew\\nBefore the king: he, cautious, backward drew\\nHis horse compell’d; foreboding in his fears\\nThe rattling ruin of the clashing cars,\\nThe floundering coursers rolling on the plain,\\nAnd conquest lost through frantic haste to gain.\\nBut thus upbraids his rival as he flies:\\n“Go, furious youth! ungenerous and unwise!\\nGo, but expect not I’ll the prize resign;\\nAdd perjury to fraud, and make it thine—”\\nThen to his steeds with all his force he cries,\\n“Be swift, be vigorous, and regain the prize!\\nYour rivals, destitute of youthful force,\\nWith fainting knees shall labour in the course,\\nAnd yield the glory yours.”—The steeds obey;\\nAlready at their heels they wing their way,\\nAnd seem already to retrieve the day.\\n\\nMeantime the Grecians in a ring beheld\\nThe coursers bounding o’er the dusty field.\\nThe first who mark’d them was the Cretan king;\\nHigh on a rising ground, above the ring,\\nThe monarch sat: from whence with sure survey\\nHe well observed the chief who led the way,\\nAnd heard from far his animating cries,\\nAnd saw the foremost steed with sharpen’d eyes;\\nOn whose broad front a blaze of shining white,\\nLike the full moon, stood obvious to the sight.\\nHe saw; and rising, to the Greeks begun:\\n“Are yonder horse discern’d by me alone?\\nOr can ye, all, another chief survey,\\nAnd other steeds than lately led the way?\\nThose, though the swiftest, by some god withheld,\\nLie sure disabled in the middle field:\\nFor, since the goal they doubled, round the plain\\nI search to find them, but I search in vain.\\nPerchance the reins forsook the driver’s hand,\\nAnd, turn’d too short, he tumbled on the strand,\\nShot from the chariot; while his coursers stray\\nWith frantic fury from the destined way.\\nRise then some other, and inform my sight,\\nFor these dim eyes, perhaps, discern not right;\\nYet sure he seems, to judge by shape and air,\\nThe great Ætolian chief, renown’d in war.”\\n\\n“Old man! (Oïleus rashly thus replies)\\nThy tongue too hastily confers the prize;\\nOf those who view the course, nor sharpest eyed,\\nNor youngest, yet the readiest to decide.\\nEumelus’ steeds, high bounding in the chase,\\nStill, as at first, unrivall’d lead the race:\\nI well discern him, as he shakes the rein,\\nAnd hear his shouts victorious o’er the plain.”\\n\\nThus he. Idomeneus, incensed, rejoin’d:\\n“Barbarous of words! and arrogant of mind!\\nContentious prince, of all the Greeks beside\\nThe last in merit, as the first in pride!\\nTo vile reproach what answer can we make?\\nA goblet or a tripod let us stake,\\nAnd be the king the judge. The most unwise\\nWill learn their rashness, when they pay the price.”\\n\\nHe said: and Ajax, by mad passion borne,\\nStern had replied; fierce scorn enhancing scorn\\nTo fell extremes. But Thetis’ godlike son\\nAwful amidst them rose, and thus begun:\\n\\n“Forbear, ye chiefs! reproachful to contend;\\nMuch would ye blame, should others thus offend:\\nAnd lo! the approaching steeds your contest end.”\\nNo sooner had he spoke, but thundering near,\\nDrives, through a stream of dust, the charioteer.\\nHigh o’er his head the circling lash he wields:\\nHis bounding horses scarcely touch the fields:\\nHis car amidst the dusty whirlwind roll’d,\\nBright with the mingled blaze of tin and gold,\\nRefulgent through the cloud: no eye could find\\nThe track his flying wheels had left behind:\\nAnd the fierce coursers urged their rapid pace\\nSo swift, it seem’d a flight, and not a race.\\nNow victor at the goal Tydides stands,\\nQuits his bright car, and springs upon the sands;\\nFrom the hot steeds the sweaty torrents stream;\\nThe well-plied whip is hung athwart the beam:\\nWith joy brave Sthenelus receives the prize,\\nThe tripod-vase, and dame with radiant eyes:\\nThese to the ships his train triumphant leads,\\nThe chief himself unyokes the panting steeds.\\n\\nYoung Nestor follows (who by art, not force,\\nO’erpass’d Atrides) second in the course.\\nBehind, Atrides urged the race, more near\\nThan to the courser in his swift career\\nThe following car, just touching with his heel\\nAnd brushing with his tail the whirling wheel:\\nSuch, and so narrow now the space between\\nThe rivals, late so distant on the green;\\nSo soon swift Æthe her lost ground regain’d,\\nOne length, one moment, had the race obtain’d.\\n\\nMerion pursued, at greater distance still,\\nWith tardier coursers, and inferior skill.\\nLast came, Admetus! thy unhappy son;\\nSlow dragged the steeds his batter’d chariot on:\\nAchilles saw, and pitying thus begun:\\n\\n“Behold! the man whose matchless art surpass’d\\nThe sons of Greece! the ablest, yet the last!\\nFortune denies, but justice bids us pay\\n(Since great Tydides bears the first away)\\nTo him the second honours of the day.”\\n\\nThe Greeks consent with loud-applauding cries,\\nAnd then Eumelus had received the prize,\\nBut youthful Nestor, jealous of his fame,\\nThe award opposes, and asserts his claim.\\n“Think not (he cries) I tamely will resign,\\nO Peleus’ son! the mare so justly mine.\\nWhat if the gods, the skilful to confound,\\nHave thrown the horse and horseman to the ground?\\nPerhaps he sought not heaven by sacrifice,\\nAnd vows omitted forfeited the prize.\\nIf yet (distinction to thy friend to show,\\nAnd please a soul desirous to bestow)\\nSome gift must grace Eumelus, view thy store\\nOf beauteous handmaids, steeds, and shining ore;\\nAn ample present let him thence receive,\\nAnd Greece shall praise thy generous thirst to give.\\nBut this my prize I never shall forego;\\nThis, who but touches, warriors! is my foe.”\\n\\nThus spake the youth; nor did his words offend;\\nPleased with the well-turn’d flattery of a friend,\\nAchilles smiled: “The gift proposed (he cried),\\nAntilochus! we shall ourself provide.\\nWith plates of brass the corslet cover’d o’er,\\n(The same renown’d Asteropaeus wore,)\\nWhose glittering margins raised with silver shine,\\n(No vulgar gift,) Eumelus! shall be thine.”\\n\\nHe said: Automedon at his command\\nThe corslet brought, and gave it to his hand.\\nDistinguish’d by his friend, his bosom glows\\nWith generous joy: then Menelaus rose;\\nThe herald placed the sceptre in his hands,\\nAnd still’d the clamour of the shouting bands.\\nNot without cause incensed at Nestor’s son,\\nAnd inly grieving, thus the king begun:\\n\\n“The praise of wisdom, in thy youth obtain’d,\\nAn act so rash, Antilochus! has stain’d.\\nRobb’d of my glory and my just reward,\\nTo you, O Grecians! be my wrong declared:\\nSo not a leader shall our conduct blame,\\nOr judge me envious of a rival’s fame.\\nBut shall not we, ourselves, the truth maintain?\\nWhat needs appealing in a fact so plain?\\nWhat Greek shall blame me, if I bid thee rise,\\nAnd vindicate by oath th’ ill-gotten prize?\\nRise if thou darest, before thy chariot stand,\\nThe driving scourge high-lifted in thy hand;\\nAnd touch thy steeds, and swear thy whole intent\\nWas but to conquer, not to circumvent.\\nSwear by that god whose liquid arms surround\\nThe globe, and whose dread earthquakes heave the ground!”\\n\\nThe prudent chief with calm attention heard;\\nThen mildly thus: “Excuse, if youth have err’d;\\nSuperior as thou art, forgive the offence,\\nNor I thy equal, or in years, or sense.\\nThou know’st the errors of unripen’d age,\\nWeak are its counsels, headlong is its rage.\\nThe prize I quit, if thou thy wrath resign;\\nThe mare, or aught thou ask’st, be freely thine\\nEre I become (from thy dear friendship torn)\\nHateful to thee, and to the gods forsworn.”\\n\\nSo spoke Antilochus; and at the word\\nThe mare contested to the king restored.\\nJoy swells his soul: as when the vernal grain\\nLifts the green ear above the springing plain,\\nThe fields their vegetable life renew,\\nAnd laugh and glitter with the morning dew;\\nSuch joy the Spartan’s shining face o’erspread,\\nAnd lifted his gay heart, while thus he said:\\n\\n“Still may our souls, O generous youth! agree\\n’Tis now Atrides’ turn to yield to thee.\\nRash heat perhaps a moment might control,\\nNot break, the settled temper of thy soul.\\nNot but (my friend) ’tis still the wiser way\\nTo waive contention with superior sway;\\nFor ah! how few, who should like thee offend,\\nLike thee, have talents to regain the friend!\\nTo plead indulgence, and thy fault atone,\\nSuffice thy father’s merit and thy own:\\nGenerous alike, for me, the sire and son\\nHave greatly suffer’d, and have greatly done.\\nI yield; that all may know, my soul can bend,\\nNor is my pride preferr’d before my friend.”\\n\\nHe said; and pleased his passion to command,\\nResign’d the courser to Noemon’s hand,\\nFriend of the youthful chief: himself content,\\nThe shining charger to his vessel sent.\\nThe golden talents Merion next obtain’d;\\nThe fifth reward, the double bowl, remain’d.\\nAchilles this to reverend Nestor bears.\\nAnd thus the purpose of his gift declares:\\n“Accept thou this, O sacred sire! (he said)\\nIn dear memorial of Patroclus dead;\\nDead and for ever lost Patroclus lies,\\nFor ever snatch’d from our desiring eyes!\\nTake thou this token of a grateful heart,\\nThough ’tis not thine to hurl the distant dart,\\nThe quoit to toss, the ponderous mace to wield,\\nOr urge the race, or wrestle on the field:\\nThy pristine vigour age has overthrown,\\nBut left the glory of the past thy own.”\\n\\nHe said, and placed the goblet at his side;\\nWith joy the venerable king replied:\\n\\n“Wisely and well, my son, thy words have proved\\nA senior honour’d, and a friend beloved!\\nToo true it is, deserted of my strength,\\nThese wither’d arms and limbs have fail’d at length.\\nOh! had I now that force I felt of yore,\\nKnown through Buprasium and the Pylian shore!\\nVictorious then in every solemn game,\\nOrdain’d to Amarynces’ mighty name;\\nThe brave Epeians gave my glory way,\\nÆtolians, Pylians, all resign’d the day.\\nI quell’d Clytomedes in fights of hand,\\nAnd backward hurl’d Ancæus on the sand,\\nSurpass’d Iphyclus in the swift career,\\nPhyleus and Polydorus with the spear.\\nThe sons of Actor won the prize of horse,\\nBut won by numbers, not by art or force:\\nFor the famed twins, impatient to survey\\nPrize after prize by Nestor borne away,\\nSprung to their car; and with united pains\\nOne lash’d the coursers, while one ruled the reins.\\nSuch once I was! Now to these tasks succeeds\\nA younger race, that emulate our deeds:\\nI yield, alas! (to age who must not yield?)\\nThough once the foremost hero of the field.\\nGo thou, my son! by generous friendship led,\\nWith martial honours decorate the dead:\\nWhile pleased I take the gift thy hands present,\\n(Pledge of benevolence, and kind intent,)\\nRejoiced, of all the numerous Greeks, to see\\nNot one but honours sacred age and me:\\nThose due distinctions thou so well canst pay,\\nMay the just gods return another day!”\\n\\nProud of the gift, thus spake the full of days:\\nAchilles heard him, prouder of the praise.\\n\\nThe prizes next are order’d to the field,\\nFor the bold champions who the caestus wield.\\nA stately mule, as yet by toils unbroke,\\nOf six years’ age, unconscious of the yoke,\\nIs to the circus led, and firmly bound;\\nNext stands a goblet, massy, large, and round.\\nAchilles rising, thus: “Let Greece excite\\nTwo heroes equal to this hardy fight;\\nWho dare the foe with lifted arms provoke,\\nAnd rush beneath the long-descending stroke.\\nOn whom Apollo shall the palm bestow,\\nAnd whom the Greeks supreme by conquest know,\\nThis mule his dauntless labours shall repay,\\nThe vanquish’d bear the massy bowl away.”\\n\\nThis dreadful combat great Epeüs chose;[291]\\nHigh o’er the crowd, enormous bulk! he rose,\\nAnd seized the beast, and thus began to say:\\n“Stand forth some man, to bear the bowl away!\\n(Price of his ruin: for who dares deny\\nThis mule my right; the undoubted victor I)\\nOthers, ’tis own’d, in fields of battle shine,\\nBut the first honours of this fight are mine;\\nFor who excels in all? Then let my foe\\nDraw near, but first his certain fortune know;\\nSecure this hand shall his whole frame confound,\\nMash all his bones, and all his body pound:\\nSo let his friends be nigh, a needful train,\\nTo heave the batter’d carcase off the plain.”\\n\\nThe giant spoke; and in a stupid gaze\\nThe host beheld him, silent with amaze!\\n’Twas thou, Euryalus! who durst aspire\\nTo meet his might, and emulate thy sire,\\nThe great Mecistheus; who in days of yore\\nIn Theban games the noblest trophy bore,\\n(The games ordain’d dead OEdipus to grace,)\\nAnd singly vanquish the Cadmean race.\\nHim great Tydides urges to contend,\\nWarm with the hopes of conquest for his friend;\\nOfficious with the cincture girds him round;\\nAnd to his wrist the gloves of death are bound.\\nAmid the circle now each champion stands,\\nAnd poises high in air his iron hands;\\nWith clashing gauntlets now they fiercely close,\\nTheir crackling jaws re-echo to the blows,\\nAnd painful sweat from all their members flows.\\nAt length Epeus dealt a weighty blow\\nFull on the cheek of his unwary foe;\\nBeneath that ponderous arm’s resistless sway\\nDown dropp’d he, nerveless, and extended lay.\\nAs a large fish, when winds and waters roar,\\nBy some huge billow dash’d against the shore,\\nLies panting; not less batter’d with his wound,\\nThe bleeding hero pants upon the ground.\\nTo rear his fallen foe, the victor lends,\\nScornful, his hand; and gives him to his friends;\\nWhose arms support him, reeling through the throng,\\nAnd dragging his disabled legs along;\\nNodding, his head hangs down his shoulder o’er;\\nHis mouth and nostrils pour the clotted gore;[292]\\nWrapp’d round in mists he lies, and lost to thought;\\nHis friends receive the bowl, too dearly bought.\\n\\nThe third bold game Achilles next demands,\\nAnd calls the wrestlers to the level sands:\\nA massy tripod for the victor lies,\\nOf twice six oxen its reputed price;\\nAnd next, the loser’s spirits to restore,\\nA female captive, valued but at four.\\nScarce did the chief the vigorous strife propose\\nWhen tower-like Ajax and Ulysses rose.\\nAmid the ring each nervous rival stands,\\nEmbracing rigid with implicit hands.\\nClose lock’d above, their heads and arms are mix’d:\\nBelow, their planted feet at distance fix’d;\\nLike two strong rafters which the builder forms,\\nProof to the wintry winds and howling storms,\\nTheir tops connected, but at wider space\\nFix’d on the centre stands their solid base.\\nNow to the grasp each manly body bends;\\nThe humid sweat from every pore descends;\\nTheir bones resound with blows: sides, shoulders, thighs\\nSwell to each gripe, and bloody tumours rise.\\nNor could Ulysses, for his art renown’d,\\nO’erturn the strength of Ajax on the ground;\\nNor could the strength of Ajax overthrow\\nThe watchful caution of his artful foe.\\nWhile the long strife even tired the lookers on,\\nThus to Ulysses spoke great Telamon:\\n“Or let me lift thee, chief, or lift thou me:\\nProve we our force, and Jove the rest decree.”\\n\\nHe said; and, straining, heaved him off the ground\\nWith matchless strength; that time Ulysses found\\nThe strength to evade, and where the nerves combine\\nHis ankle struck: the giant fell supine;\\nUlysses, following, on his bosom lies;\\nShouts of applause run rattling through the skies.\\nAjax to lift Ulysses next essays;\\nHe barely stirr’d him, but he could not raise:\\nHis knee lock’d fast, the foe’s attempt denied;\\nAnd grappling close, they tumbled side by side.\\nDefiled with honourable dust they roll,\\nStill breathing strife, and unsubdued of soul:\\nAgain they rage, again to combat rise;\\nWhen great Achilles thus divides the prize:\\n\\n“Your noble vigour, O my friends, restrain;\\nNor weary out your generous strength in vain.\\nYe both have won: let others who excel,\\nNow prove that prowess you have proved so well.”\\n\\nThe hero’s words the willing chiefs obey,\\nFrom their tired bodies wipe the dust away,\\nAnd, clothed anew, the following games survey.\\n\\nAnd now succeed the gifts ordain’d to grace\\nThe youths contending in the rapid race:\\nA silver urn that full six measures held,\\nBy none in weight or workmanship excell’d:\\nSidonian artists taught the frame to shine,\\nElaborate, with artifice divine;\\nWhence Tyrian sailors did the prize transport,\\nAnd gave to Thoas at the Lemnian port:\\nFrom him descended, good Eunaeus heir’d\\nThe glorious gift; and, for Lycaon spared,\\nTo brave Patroclus gave the rich reward:\\nNow, the same hero’s funeral rites to grace,\\nIt stands the prize of swiftness in the race.\\nA well-fed ox was for the second placed;\\nAnd half a talent must content the last.\\nAchilles rising then bespoke the train:\\n“Who hope the palm of swiftness to obtain,\\nStand forth, and bear these prizes from the plain.”\\n\\nThe hero said, and starting from his place,\\nOilean Ajax rises to the race;\\nUlysses next; and he whose speed surpass’d\\nHis youthful equals, Nestor’s son, the last.\\nRanged in a line the ready racers stand;\\nPelides points the barrier with his hand;\\nAll start at once; Oïleus led the race;\\nThe next Ulysses, measuring pace with pace;\\nBehind him, diligently close, he sped,\\nAs closely following as the running thread\\nThe spindle follows, and displays the charms\\nOf the fair spinster’s breast and moving arms:\\nGraceful in motion thus, his foe he plies,\\nAnd treads each footstep ere the dust can rise;\\nHis glowing breath upon his shoulders plays:\\nThe admiring Greeks loud acclamations raise:\\nTo him they give their wishes, hearts, and eyes,\\nAnd send their souls before him as he flies.\\nNow three times turn’d in prospect of the goal,\\nThe panting chief to Pallas lifts his soul:\\n“Assist, O goddess!” thus in thought he pray’d!\\nAnd present at his thought descends the maid.\\nBuoy’d by her heavenly force, he seems to swim,\\nAnd feels a pinion lifting every limb.\\nAll fierce, and ready now the prize to gain,\\nUnhappy Ajax stumbles on the plain\\n(O’erturn’d by Pallas), where the slippery shore\\nWas clogg’d with slimy dung and mingled gore.\\n(The self-same place beside Patroclus’ pyre,\\nWhere late the slaughter’d victims fed the fire.)\\nBesmear’d with filth, and blotted o’er with clay,\\nObscene to sight, the rueful racer lay;\\nThe well-fed bull (the second prize) he shared,\\nAnd left the urn Ulysses’ rich reward.\\nThen, grasping by the horn the mighty beast,\\nThe baffled hero thus the Greeks address’d:\\n\\n“Accursed fate! the conquest I forego;\\nA mortal I, a goddess was my foe;\\nShe urged her favourite on the rapid way,\\nAnd Pallas, not Ulysses, won the day.”\\n\\nThus sourly wail’d he, sputtering dirt and gore;\\nA burst of laughter echoed through the shore.\\nAntilochus, more humorous than the rest,\\nTakes the last prize, and takes it with a jest:\\n\\n“Why with our wiser elders should we strive?\\nThe gods still love them, and they always thrive.\\nYe see, to Ajax I must yield the prize:\\nHe to Ulysses, still more aged and wise;\\n(A green old age unconscious of decays,\\nThat proves the hero born in better days!)\\nBehold his vigour in this active race!\\nAchilles only boasts a swifter pace:\\nFor who can match Achilles? He who can,\\nMust yet be more than hero, more than man.”\\n\\nThe effect succeeds the speech.

The old\\nking, notwithstanding the remonstrances of his queen, makes ready for\\nthe journey, to which he is encouraged by an omen from Jupiter.

Mercury descends in the shape of a young\\nman, and conducts him to the pavilion of Achilles. Their conversation\\non the way. Priam finds Achilles at his table, casts himself at his\\nfeet, and begs for the body of his son: Achilles, moved with\\ncompassion, grants his request, detains him one night in his tent, and\\nthe next morning sends him home with the body: the Trojans run out to\\nmeet him.

this goblet take,\\nA pledge of gratitude for Hector’s sake;\\nAnd while the favouring gods our steps survey,\\nSafe to Pelides’ tent conduct my way.”\\n\\nTo whom the latent god: “O king, forbear\\nTo tempt my youth, for apt is youth to err.\\nBut can I, absent from my prince’s sight,\\nTake gifts in secret, that must shun the light?\\nWhat from our master’s interest thus we draw,\\nIs but a licensed theft that ’scapes the law.\\nRespecting him, my soul abjures the offence;\\nAnd as the crime, I dread the consequence.\\nThee, far as Argos, pleased I could convey;\\nGuard of thy life, and partner of thy way:\\nOn thee attend, thy safety to maintain,\\nO’er pathless forests, or the roaring main.”\\n\\nHe said, then took the chariot at a bound,\\nAnd snatch’d the reins, and whirl’d the lash around:\\nBefore the inspiring god that urged them on,\\nThe coursers fly with spirit not their own.\\nAnd now they reach’d the naval walls, and found\\nThe guards repasting, while the bowls go round;\\nOn these the virtue of his wand he tries,\\nAnd pours deep slumber on their watchful eyes:\\nThen heaved the massy gates, removed the bars,\\nAnd o’er the trenches led the rolling cars.\\nUnseen, through all the hostile camp they went,\\nAnd now approach’d Pelides’ lofty tent.\\nOn firs the roof was raised, and cover’d o’er\\nWith reeds collected from the marshy shore;\\nAnd, fenced with palisades, a hall of state,\\n(The work of soldiers,) where the hero sat:\\nLarge was the door, whose well-compacted strength\\nA solid pine-tree barr’d of wondrous length:\\nScarce three strong Greeks could lift its mighty weight,\\nBut great Achilles singly closed the gate.\\nThis Hermes (such the power of gods) set wide;\\nThen swift alighted the celestial guide,\\nAnd thus reveal’d—”Hear, prince!

But instead of endeavouring to\\nraise a vain monument to myself, of the merits or difficulties of it\\n(which must be left to the world, to truth, and to posterity), let me\\nleave behind me a memorial of my friendship with one of the most\\nvaluable of men, as well as finest writers, of my age and country, one\\nwho has tried, and knows by his own experience, how hard an undertaking\\nit is to do justice to Homer, and one whom (I am sure) sincerely\\nrejoices with me at the period of my labours. To him, therefore, having\\nbrought this long work to a conclusion, I desire to dedicate it, and to\\nhave the honour and satisfaction of placing together, in this manner,\\nthe names of Mr. CONGREVE, and of\\n\\nMarch 25, 1720\\n\\nA.

Hence\\n the delight when we recognize an act of nobility or justice in our\\n hereditary princes\\n\\n“‘Tuque prior, tu parce genus qui ducis Olympo,\\nProjice tela manu _sanguis meus_’\\n\\n“So strong is this feeling, that it regains an engrafted influence even\\nwhen history witnesses that vast convulsions have rent and weakened it\\nand the Celtic feeling towards the Stuarts has been rekindled in our\\nown days towards the granddaughter of George the Third of Hanover.\\n    “Somewhat similar may be seen in the disposition to idolize those\\n    great lawgivers of man’s race, who have given expression, in the\\n    immortal language of song, to the deeper inspirations of our\\n    nature. The thoughts of Homer or of Shakespere are the universal\\n    inheritance of the human race. In this mutual ground every man\\n    meets his brother, they have been set forth by the providence of\\n    God to vindicate for all of us what nature could effect, and that,\\n    in these representatives of our race, we might recognize our common\\n    benefactors.’—_Doctrine of the Incarnation_, pp. 9, 10.\\n\\n [2] Εἰκος δέ μιν ἦν καὶ μνημόσυνα πάντων γράφεσθαι.

The bard was provided with a harp on which he played a\\n prelude, to elevate and inspire his mind, and with which he\\n accompanied the song when begun. His voice probably preserved a medium\\n between singing and recitation; the words, and not the melody were\\n regarded by the listeners, hence it was necessary for him to remain\\n intelligible to all. In countries where nothing similar is found, it\\n is difficult to represent such scenes to the mind; but whoever has had\\n an opportunity of listening to the improvisation of Italy, can easily\\n form an idea of Demodocus and Phemius.”—_Ancient Greece_, p. 94.\\n\\n [4] “Should it not be, since _my_ arrival? asks Mackenzie, observing\\n that “poplars can hardly live so long”. But setting aside the fact\\n that we must not expect consistency in a mere romance, the ancients\\n had a superstitious belief in the great age of trees which grew near\\n places consecrated by the presence of gods and great men. See Cicero\\n de Legg II I, sub init., where he speaks of the plane tree under which\\n Socrates used to walk and of the tree at Delos, where Latona gave\\n birth to Apollo.

To take an ordinary case, we might refer to\\n that of any first rate actor, who must be prepared, at a very short\\n warning, to ‘rhapsodize,’ night after night, parts which when laid\\n together, would amount to an immense number of lines. But all this is\\n nothing to two instances of our own day. Visiting at Naples a\\n gentleman of the highest intellectual attainments, and who held a\\n distinguished rank among the men of letters in the last century, he\\n informed us that the day before he had passed much time in examining a\\n man, not highly educated, who had learned to repeat the whole\\n Gierusalemme of Tasso, not only to recite it consecutively, but also\\n to repeat those stanzas in utter defiance of the sense, either\\n forwards or backwards, or from the eighth line to the first,\\n alternately the odd and even lines—in short, whatever the passage\\n required; the memory, which seemed to cling to the words much more\\n than to the sense, had it at such perfect command, that it could\\n produce it under any form. Our informant went on to state that this\\n singular being was proceeding to learn the Orlando Furioso in the same\\n manner. But even this instance is less wonderful than one as to which\\n we may appeal to any of our readers that happened some twenty years\\n ago to visit the town of Stirling, in Scotland. No such person can\\n have forgotten the poor, uneducated man Blind Jamie who could actually\\n repeat, after a few minutes consideration any verse required from any\\n part of the Bible—even the obscurest and most unimportant enumeration\\n of mere proper names not excepted. We do not mention these facts as\\n touching the more difficult part of the question before us, but facts\\n they are; and if we find so much difficulty in calculating the extent\\n to which the mere memory may be cultivated, are we, in these days of\\n multifarious reading, and of countless distracting affairs, fair\\n judges of the perfection to which the invention and the memory\\n combined may attain in a simpler age, and among a more single minded\\n people?—Quarterly Review, _l. c._, p. 143, sqq.\\n    Heeren steers between the two opinions, observing that, “The\\n    Dschungariade of the Calmucks is said to surpass the poems of Homer\\n    in length, as much as it stands beneath them in merit, and yet it\\n    exists only in the memory of a people which is not unacquainted\\n    with writing. But the songs of a nation are probably the last\\n    things which are committed to writing, for the very reason that\\n    they are remembered.”— _Ancient Greece_. p. 100.\\n\\n [26] Vol. II p. 198, sqq.\\n\\n [27] Quarterly Review, _l. c._, p. 131 sq.\\n\\n [28] Betrachtungen über die Ilias.

I. vers. 155, &c.\\n\\n [40] The following argument of the Iliad, corrected in a few\\n particulars, is translated from Bitaubé, and is, perhaps, the neatest\\n summary that has ever been drawn up:—“A hero, injured by his general,\\n and animated with a noble resentment, retires to his tent; and for a\\n season withdraws himself and his troops from the war. During this\\n interval, victory abandons the army, which for nine years has been\\n occupied in a great enterprise, upon the successful termination of\\n which the honour of their country depends. The general, at length\\n opening his eyes to the fault which he had committed, deputes the\\n principal officers of his army to the incensed hero, with commission\\n to make compensation for the injury, and to tender magnificent\\n presents. The hero, according to the proud obstinacy of his character,\\n persists in his animosity; the army is again defeated, and is on the\\n verge of entire destruction. This inexorable man has a friend; this\\n friend weeps before him, and asks for the hero’s arms, and for\\n permission to go to the war in his stead. The eloquence of friendship\\n prevails more than the intercession of the ambassadors or the gifts of\\n the general. He lends his armour to his friend, but commands him not\\n to engage with the chief of the enemy’s army, because he reserves to\\n himself the honour of that combat, and because he also fears for his\\n friend’s life. The prohibition is forgotten; the friend listens to\\n nothing but his courage; his corpse is brought back to the hero, and\\n the hero’s arms become the prize of the conqueror. Then the hero,\\n given up to the most lively despair, prepares to fight; he receives\\n from a divinity new armour, is reconciled with his general and,\\n thirsting for glory and revenge, enacts prodigies of valour, recovers\\n the victory, slays the enemy’s chief, honours his friend with superb\\n funeral rites, and exercises a cruel vengeance on the body of his\\n destroyer; but finally appeased by the tears and prayers of the father\\n of the slain warrior, restores to the old man the corpse of his son,\\n which he buries with due solemnities.’—Coleridge, p. 177, sqq.\\n\\n [41] Vultures: Pope is more accurate than the poet he translates, for\\n Homer writes “a prey to dogs and to _all_ kinds of birds. But all\\n kinds of birds are not carnivorous.\\n\\n [42] _i.e._ during the whole time of their striving the will of Jove\\n was being gradually accomplished.\\n\\n [43] Compare Milton’s “Paradise Lost” i. 6\\n\\n“Sing, heavenly Muse, that on the secret top\\nOf Horeb, or of Sinai, didst inspire\\nThat shepherd.”\\n\\n [44] _Latona’s son: i.e._ Apollo.\\n\\n [45] _King of men:_ Agamemnon.\\n\\n [46] _Brother kings:_ Menelaus and Agamemnon.\\n\\n [47] _Smintheus_ an epithet taken from sminthos, the Phrygian name\\n for a _mouse_, was applied to Apollo for having put an end to a plague\\n of mice which had harassed that territory. Strabo, however, says, that\\n when the Teucri were migrating from Crete, they were told by an oracle\\n to settle in that place, where they should not be attacked by the\\n original inhabitants of the land, and that, having halted for the\\n night, a number of field-mice came and gnawed away the leathern straps\\n of their baggage, and thongs of their armour. In fulfilment of the\\n oracle, they settled on the spot, and raised a temple to Sminthean\\n Apollo. Grote, “History of Greece,” i. p. 68, remarks that the\\n “worship of Sminthean Apollo, in various parts of the Troad and its\\n neighboring territory, dates before the earliest period of Æolian\\n colonization.”\\n\\n [48] _Cilla_, a town of Troas near Thebe, so called from Cillus, a\\n sister of Hippodamia, slain by Œnomaus.\\n\\n [49] A mistake. It should be,\\n\\n“If e’er I roofed thy graceful fane,”\\n\\nfor the custom of decorating temples with garlands was of later date.\\n\\n [50] _Bent was his bow_ “The Apollo of Homer, it must be borne in\\n mind, is a different character from the deity of the same name in the\\n later classical pantheon. Throughout both poems, all deaths from\\n unforeseen or invisible causes, the ravages of pestilence, the fate of\\n the young child or promising adult, cut off in the germ of infancy or\\n flower of youth, of the old man dropping peacefully into the grave, or\\n of the reckless sinner suddenly checked in his career of crime, are\\n ascribed to the arrows of Apollo or Diana. The oracular functions of\\n the god rose naturally out of the above fundamental attributes, for\\n who could more appropriately impart to mortals what little\\n foreknowledge Fate permitted of her decrees than the agent of her most\\n awful dispensations? The close union of the arts of prophecy and song\\n explains his additional office of god of music, while the arrows with\\n which he and his sister were armed, symbols of sudden death in every\\n age, no less naturally procured him that of god of archery. Of any\\n connection between Apollo and the Sun, whatever may have existed in\\n the more esoteric doctrine of the Greek sanctuaries, there is no trace\\n in either Iliad or Odyssey.”—Mure, “History of Greek Literature,” vol.\\n i. p. 478, sq.\\n\\n [51] It has frequently been observed, that most pestilences begin with\\n animals, and that Homer had this fact in mind.\\n\\n [52] _Convened to council_. The public assembly in the heroic times is\\n well characterized by Grote, vol. ii. p 92. “It is an assembly for\\n talk. Communication and discussion to a certain extent by the chiefs\\n in person, of the people as listeners and sympathizers—often for\\n eloquence, and sometimes for quarrel—but here its ostensible purposes\\n end.”\\n\\n [53] Old Jacob Duport, whose “Gnomologia Homerica” is full of curious\\n and useful things, quotes several passages of the ancients, in which\\n reference is made to these words of Homer, in maintenance of the\\n belief that dreams had a divine origin and an import in which men were\\n interested.\\n\\n [54] Rather, “bright-eyed.” See the German critics quoted by Arnold.\\n\\n [55] The prize given to Ajax was Tecmessa, while Ulysses received\\n Laodice, the daughter of Cycnus.\\n\\n [56] The Myrmidons dwelt on the southern borders of Thessaly, and took\\n their origin from Myrmido, son of Jupiter and Eurymedusa. It is\\n fancifully supposed that the name was derived from myrmaex, an _ant_,\\n “because they imitated the diligence of the ants, and like them were\\n indefatigable, continually employed in cultivating the earth; the\\n change from ants to men is founded merely on the equivocation of their\\n name, which resembles that of the ant: they bore a further resemblance\\n to these little animals, in that instead of inhabiting towns or\\n villages, at first they commonly resided in the open fields, having no\\n other retreats but dens and the cavities of trees, until Ithacus\\n brought them together, and settled them in more secure and comfortable\\n habitations.”—Anthon’s “Lempriere.”\\n\\n [57] Eustathius, after Heraclides Ponticus and others, allegorizes\\n this apparition, as if the appearance of Minerva to Achilles, unseen\\n by the rest, was intended to point out the sudden recollection that he\\n would gain nothing by intemperate wrath, and that it were best to\\n restrain his anger, and only gratify it by withdrawing his services.\\n The same idea is rather cleverly worked out by Apuleius, “De Deo\\n Socratis.”\\n\\n [58] Compare Milton, “Paradise Lost,” bk. ii:\\n\\n“Though his tongue\\nDropp’d manna.”\\n\\nSo Proverbs v. 3, “For the lips of a strange woman drop as an\\nhoney-comb.”\\n\\n [59] Salt water was chiefly used in lustrations, from its being\\n supposed to possess certain fiery particles. Hence, if sea-water could\\n not be obtained, salt was thrown into the fresh water to be used for\\n the lustration. Menander, in Clem. Alex. vii. p.713, hydati\\n perriranai, embalon alas, phakois.\\n\\n [60] The persons of heralds were held inviolable, and they were at\\n liberty to travel whither they would without fear of molestation.\\n Pollux, Onom. viii. p. 159. The office was generally given to old men,\\n and they were believed to be under the especial protection of Jove and\\n Mercury.\\n\\n [61] His mother, Thetis, the daughter of Nereus and Doris, who was\\n courted by Neptune and Jupiter. When, however, it was known that the\\n son to whom she would give birth must prove greater than his father,\\n it was determined to wed her to a mortal, and Peleus, with great\\n difficulty, succeeded in obtaining her hand, as she eluded him by\\n assuming various forms. Her children were all destroyed by fire\\n through her attempts to see whether they were immortal, and Achilles\\n would have shared the same fate had not his father rescued him. She\\n afterwards rendered him invulnerable by plunging him into the waters\\n of the Styx, with the exception of that part of the heel by which she\\n held him. Hygin.

Of the gloomy destiny reigning throughout the\\n Homeric poems, and from which even the gods are not exempt, Schlegel\\n well observes, “This power extends also to the world of gods— for the\\n Grecian gods are mere powers of nature—and although immeasurably\\n higher than mortal man, yet, compared with infinitude, they are on an\\n equal footing with himself.”—‘Lectures on the Drama’ v. p. 67.\\n\\n [66] It has been observed that the annual procession of the sacred\\n ship so often represented on Egyptian monuments, and the return of the\\n deity from Ethiopia after some days’ absence, serves to show the\\n Ethiopian origin of Thebes, and of the worship of Jupiter Ammon. “I\\n think,” says Heeren, after quoting a passage from Diodorus about the\\n holy ship, “that this procession is represented in one of the great\\n sculptured reliefs on the temple of Karnak. The sacred ship of Ammon\\n is on the shore with its whole equipment, and is towed along by\\n another boat. It is therefore on its voyage. This must have been one\\n of the most celebrated festivals, since, even according to the\\n interpretation of antiquity, Homer alludes to it when he speaks of\\n Jupiter’s visit to the Ethiopians, and his twelve days’\\n absence.”—Long, “Egyptian Antiquities” vol. 1 p. 96. Eustathius, vol.\\n 1 p. 98, sq. (ed. Basil) gives this interpretation, and likewise an\\n allegorical one, which we will spare the reader.\\n\\n [67] _Atoned_, i.e. reconciled. This is the proper and most natural\\n meaning of the word, as may be seen from Taylor’s remarks in Calmet’s\\n Dictionary, p.110, of my edition.\\n\\n [68] That is, drawing back their necks while they cut their throats.\\n “If the sacrifice was in honour of the celestial gods, the throat was\\n bent upwards towards heaven; but if made to the heroes, or infernal\\n deities, it was killed with its throat toward the ground.”— “Elgin\\n Marbles,” vol i. p.81.\\n\\n“The jolly crew, unmindful of the past,\\nThe quarry share, their plenteous dinner haste,\\nSome strip the skin; some portion out the spoil;\\nThe limbs yet trembling, in the caldrons boil;\\nSome on the fire the reeking entrails broil.\\nStretch’d on the grassy turf, at ease they dine,\\nRestore their strength with meat, and cheer their souls with wine.”\\n\\nDryden’s “Virgil,” i. 293.\\n\\n [69] _Crown’d, i.e._ filled to the brim. The custom of adorning\\n goblets with flowers was of later date.\\n\\n [70] _He spoke_, &c. “When a friend inquired of Phidias what pattern\\n he had formed his Olympian Jupiter, he is said to have answered by\\n repeating the lines of the first Iliad in which the poet represents\\n the majesty of the god in the most sublime terms; thereby signifying\\n that the genius of Homer had inspired him with it. Those who beheld\\n this statue are said to have been so struck with it as to have asked\\n whether Jupiter had descended from heaven to show himself to Phidias,\\n or whether Phidias had been carried thither to contemplate the god.”—\\n “Elgin Marbles,” vol. xii p.124.\\n\\n [71] “So was his will\\nPronounced among the gods, and by an oath,\\nThat shook heav’n’s whole circumference, confirm’d.”\\n\\n“Paradise Lost” ii. 351.\\n\\n [72] _A double bowl, i.e._ a vessel with a cup at both ends, something\\n like the measures by which a halfpenny or pennyworth of nuts is sold.\\n See Buttmann, Lexic. p. 93 sq.\\n\\n [73] “Paradise Lost,” i. 44.\\n\\n“Him th’ Almighty power\\nHurl’d headlong flaming from th ethereal sky,\\nWith hideous ruin and combustion”\\n\\n [74] The occasion on which Vulcan incurred Jove’s displeasure was\\n this—After Hercules, had taken and pillaged Troy, Juno raised a storm,\\n which drove him to the island of Cos, having previously cast Jove into\\n a sleep, to prevent him aiding his son. Jove, in revenge, fastened\\n iron anvils to her feet, and hung her from the sky, and Vulcan,\\n attempting to relieve her, was kicked down from Olympus in the manner\\n described. The allegorists have gone mad in finding deep explanations\\n for this amusing fiction. See Heraclides, “Ponticus,” p. 463 sq., ed\\n Gale. The story is told by Homer himself in Book xv. The Sinthians\\n were a race of robbers, the ancient inhabitants of Lemnos which island\\n was ever after sacred to Vulcan.\\n\\n“Nor was his name unheard or unadored\\nIn ancient Greece, and in Ausonian land\\nMen call’d him Mulciber, and how he fell\\nFrom heaven, they fabled, thrown by angry Jove\\nSheer o’er the crystal battlements from morn\\nTo noon he fell, from noon to dewy eve,\\nA summer’s day and with the setting sun\\nDropp’d from the zenith like a falling star\\nOn Lemnos, th’ Aegean isle thus they relate.”\\n\\n“Paradise Lost,” i. 738\\n\\n [75] It is ingeniously observed by Grote, vol i p. 463, that “The gods\\n formed a sort of political community of their own which had its\\n hierarchy, its distribution of ranks and duties, its contentions for\\n power and occasional revolutions, its public meetings in the agora of\\n Olympus, and its multitudinous banquets or festivals.”\\n\\n [76] Plato, Rep. iii. p. 437, was so scandalized at this deception of\\n Jupiter’s, and at his other attacks on the character of the gods, that\\n he would fain sentence him to an honourable banishment. (See Minucius\\n Felix, Section 22.) Coleridge, Introd. p. 154, well observes, that the\\n supreme father of gods and men had a full right to employ a lying\\n spirit to work out his ultimate will. Compare “Paradise Lost,” v. 646:\\n\\n“And roseate dews disposed\\nAll but the unsleeping eyes of God to rest.”\\n\\n [77] —_Dream_ ought to be spelt with a capital letter, being, I think,\\n evidently personified as the god of dreams. See Anthon and others.\\n\\n“When, by Minerva sent, a _fraudful_ Dream\\nRush’d from the skies, the bane of her and Troy.”\\n\\nDyce’s “Select Translations from Quintus Calaber,” p.10.\\n\\n [78] “Sleep’st thou, companion dear, what sleep can close\\nThy eye-lids?”—“Paradise Lost,” v. 673.\\n\\n [79] This truly military sentiment has been echoed by the approving\\n voice of many a general and statesman of antiquity. See Pliny’s\\n Panegyric on Trajan. Silius neatly translates it,\\n\\n“Turpe duci totam somno consumere noctem.”\\n\\n [80] _The same in habit_, &c.\\n\\n“To whom once more the winged god appears;\\nHis former youthful mien and shape he wears.”\\n\\nDryden’s Virgil, iv. 803.\\n\\n [81] “As bees in spring-time, when\\nThe sun with Taurus rides,\\nPour forth their populous youth about the hive\\nIn clusters; they among fresh dews and flowers\\nFly to and fro, or on the smoothed plank,\\nThe suburb of this straw-built citadel,\\nNew-nibb’d with balm, expatiate and confer\\nTheir state affairs. So thick the very crowd\\nSwarm’d and were straiten’d.”—“Paradise Lost” i. 768.\\n\\n [82] It was the herald’s duty to make the people sit down. “A\\n _standing_ agora is a symptom of manifest terror (II. Xviii. 246) an\\n evening agora, to which men came elevated by wine, is also the\\n forerunner of mischief (‘Odyssey,’ iii. 138).”—Grote, ii. p. 91,\\n _note_.\\n\\n [83] This sceptre, like that of Judah (Genesis xlix. 10), is a type of\\n the supreme and far-spread dominion of the house of the Atrides. See\\n Thucydides i. 9. “It is traced through the hands of Hermes, he being\\n the wealth giving god, whose blessing is most efficacious in\\n furthering the process of acquisition.”—Grote, i. p. 212. Compare\\n Quintus Calaber (Dyce’s Selections, p. 43).\\n\\n“Thus the monarch spoke,\\nThen pledged the chief in a capacious cup,\\nGolden, and framed by art divine (a gift\\nWhich to Almighty Jove lame Vulcan brought\\nUpon his nuptial day, when he espoused\\nThe Queen of Love), the sire of gods bestow’d\\nThe cup on Dardanus, who gave it next\\nTo Ericthonius Tros received it then,\\nAnd left it, with his wealth, to be possess’d\\nBy Ilus he to great Laomedon\\nGave it, and last to Priam’s lot it fell.”\\n\\n [84] Grote, i, p. 393, states the number of the Grecian forces at\\n upwards of 100,000 men. Nichols makes a total of 135,000.\\n\\n [85] “As thick as when a field\\nOf Ceres, ripe for harvest, waving bends\\nHis bearded grove of ears, which way the wind\\nSways them.”—Paradise Lost,” iv. 980, sqq.\\n\\n [86] This sentiment used to be a popular one with some of the greatest\\n tyrants, who abused it into a pretext for unlimited usurpation of\\n power. Dion, Caligula, and Domitian were particularly fond of it, and,\\n in an extended form, we find the maxim propounded by Creon in the\\n Antigone of Sophocles. See some important remarks of Heeren, “Ancient\\n Greece,” ch. vi. p. 105.\\n\\n [87] It may be remarked, that the character of Thersites, revolting\\n and contemptible as it is, serves admirably to develop the disposition\\n of Ulysses in a new light, in which mere cunning is less prominent. Of\\n the gradual and individual development of Homer’s heroes, Schlegel\\n well observes, “In bas-relief the figures are usually in profile, and\\n in the epos all are characterized in the simplest manner in relief;\\n they are not grouped together, but follow one another; so Homer’s\\n heroes advance, one by one, in succession before us. It has been\\n remarked that the _Iliad_ is not definitively closed, but that we are\\n left to suppose something both to precede and to follow it. The\\n bas-relief is equally without limit, and may be continued _ad\\n infinitum_, either from before or behind, on which account the\\n ancients preferred for it such subjects as admitted of an indefinite\\n extension, sacrificial processions, dances, and lines of combatants,\\n and hence they also exhibit bas-reliefs on curved surfaces, such as\\n vases, or the frieze of a rotunda, where, by the curvature, the two\\n ends are withdrawn from our sight, and where, while we advance, one\\n object appears as another disappears. Reading Homer is very much like\\n such a circuit; the present object alone arresting our attention, we\\n lose sight of what precedes, and do not concern ourselves about what\\n is to follow.”—“Dramatic Literature,” p. 75.\\n\\n [88] “There cannot be a clearer indication than this description —so\\n graphic in the original poem—of the true character of the Homeric\\n agora. The multitude who compose it are listening and acquiescent, not\\n often hesitating, and never refractory to the chief. The fate which\\n awaits a presumptuous critic, even where his virulent reproaches are\\n substantially well-founded, is plainly set forth in the treatment of\\n Thersites; while the unpopularity of such a character is attested even\\n more by the excessive pains which Homer takes to heap upon him\\n repulsive personal deformities, than by the chastisement of Odysseus\\n he is lame, bald, crook-backed, of misshapen head, and squinting\\n vision.”—Grote, vol. i. p. 97.\\n\\n [89] According to Pausanias, both the sprig and the remains of the\\n tree were exhibited in his time. The tragedians, Lucretius and others,\\n adopted a different fable to account for the stoppage at Aulis, and\\n seem to have found the sacrifice of Iphigena better suited to form the\\n subject of a tragedy. Compare Dryden’s “Æneid,” vol. iii. sqq.\\n\\n [90] _Full of his god, i.e._, Apollo, filled with the prophetic\\n spirit. “_The_ god” would be more simple and emphatic.\\n\\n [91] Those critics who have maintained that the “Catalogue of Ships”\\n is an interpolation, should have paid more attention to these lines,\\n which form a most natural introduction to their enumeration.\\n\\n [92] The following observation will be useful to Homeric readers:\\n “Particular animals were, at a later time, consecrated to particular\\n deities. To Jupiter, Ceres, Juno, Apollo, and Bacchus victims of\\n advanced age might be offered. An ox of five years old was considered\\n especially acceptable to Jupiter. A black bull, a ram, or a boar pig,\\n were offerings for Neptune. A heifer, or a sheep, for Minerva. To\\n Ceres a sow was sacrificed, as an enemy to corn. The goat to Bacchus,\\n because he fed on vines. Diana was propitiated with a stag; and to\\n Venus the dove was consecrated. The infernal and evil deities were to\\n be appeased with black victims. The most acceptable of all sacrifices\\n was the heifer of a year old, which had never borne the yoke. It was\\n to be perfect in every limb, healthy, and without blemish.”—“Elgin\\n Marbles,” vol. i. p. 78.\\n\\n [93] _Idomeneus_, son of Deucalion, was king of Crete. Having vowed,\\n during a tempest, on his return from Troy, to sacrifice to Neptune the\\n first creature that should present itself to his eye on the Cretan\\n shore, his son fell a victim to his rash vow.\\n\\n [94] _Tydeus’ son, i.e._ Diomed.\\n\\n [95] That is, Ajax, the son of Oïleus, a Locrian. He must be\\n distinguished from the other, who was king of Salamis.\\n\\n [96] A great deal of nonsense has been written to account for the word\\n _unbid_, in this line. Even Plato, “Sympos.” p. 315, has found some\\n curious meaning in what, to us, appears to need no explanation. Was\\n there any _heroic_ rule of etiquette which prevented one brother-king\\n visiting another without a formal invitation?\\n\\n [97] Fresh water fowl, especially swans, were found in great numbers\\n about the Asian Marsh, a fenny tract of country in Lydia, formed by\\n the river Cayster, near its mouth. See Virgil, “Georgics,” vol. i.\\n 383, sq.\\n\\n [98] _Scamander_, or Scamandros, was a river of Troas, rising,\\n according to Strabo, on the highest part of Mount Ida, in the same\\n hill with the Granicus and the OEdipus, and falling into the sea at\\n Sigaeum; everything tends to identify it with Mendere, as Wood,\\n Rennell, and others maintain; the Mendere is 40 miles long, 300 feet\\n broad, deep in the time of flood, nearly dry in the summer. Dr. Clarke\\n successfully combats the opinion of those who make the Scamander to\\n have arisen from the springs of Bounabarshy, and traces the source of\\n the river to the highest mountain in the chain of Ida, now Kusdaghy;\\n receives the Simois in its course; towards its mouth it is very muddy,\\n and flows through marshes. Between the Scamander and Simois, Homer’s\\n Troy is supposed to have stood: this river, according to Homer, was\\n called Xanthus by the gods, Scamander by men. The waters of the\\n Scamander had the singular property of giving a beautiful colour to\\n the hair or wool of such animals as bathed in them; hence the three\\n goddesses, Minerva, Juno, and Venus, bathed there before they appeared\\n before Paris to obtain the golden apple: the name Xanthus, “yellow,”\\n was given to the Scamander, from the peculiar colour of its waters,\\n still applicable to the Mendere, the yellow colour of whose waters\\n attracts the attention of travellers.\\n\\n [99] It should be “his _chest_ like Neptune.” The torso of Neptune, in\\n the “Elgin Marbles,” No. 103, (vol. ii. p. 26,) is remarkable for its\\n breadth and massiveness of development.\\n\\n [100] “Say first, for heav’n hides nothing from thy view.”—“Paradise\\n Lost,” i. 27.\\n\\n“Ma di’ tu, Musa, come i primi danni\\nMandassero à Cristiani, e di quai parti:\\nTu ’l sai; ma di tant’ opra a noi si lunge\\nDebil aura di fama appena giunge.”—“Gier. Lib.” iv. 19.\\n\\n [101] “The Catalogue is, perhaps, the portion of the poem in favour of\\n which a claim to separate authorship has been most plausibly urged.\\n Although the example of Homer has since rendered some such formal\\n enumeration of the forces engaged, a common practice in epic poems\\n descriptive of great warlike adventures, still so minute a statistical\\n detail can neither be considered as imperatively required, nor perhaps\\n such as would, in ordinary cases, suggest itself to the mind of a\\n poet. Yet there is scarcely any portion of the Iliad where both\\n historical and internal evidence are more clearly in favour of a\\n connection from the remotest period, with the remainder of the work.\\n The composition of the Catalogue, whensoever it may have taken place,\\n necessarily presumes its author’s acquaintance with a previously\\n existing Iliad. It were impossible otherwise to account for the\\n harmony observable in the recurrence of so vast a number of proper\\n names, most of them historically unimportant, and not a few altogether\\n fictitious: or of so many geographical and genealogical details as are\\n condensed in these few hundred lines, and incidentally scattered over\\n the thousands which follow: equally inexplicable were the pointed\\n allusions occurring in this episode to events narrated in the previous\\n and subsequent text, several of which could hardly be of traditional\\n notoriety, but through the medium of the Iliad.”—Mure, “Language and\\n Literature of Greece,” vol. i. p. 263.\\n\\n [102] _Twice Sixty:_ “Thucydides observes that the Bœotian vessels,\\n which carried one hundred and twenty men each, were probably meant to\\n be the largest in the fleet, and those of Philoctetes, carrying fifty\\n each, the smallest. The average would be eighty-five, and Thucydides\\n supposes the troops to have rowed and navigated themselves; and that\\n very few, besides the chiefs, went as mere passengers or landsmen. In\\n short, we have in the Homeric descriptions the complete picture of an\\n Indian or African war canoe, many of which are considerably larger\\n than the largest scale assigned to those of the Greeks. If the total\\n number of the Greek ships be taken at twelve hundred, according to\\n Thucydides, although in point of fact there are only eleven hundred\\n and eighty-six in the Catalogue, the amount of the army, upon the\\n foregoing average, will be about a hundred and two thousand men. The\\n historian considers this a small force as representing all Greece.\\n Bryant, comparing it with the allied army at Platae, thinks it so\\n large as to prove the entire falsehood of the whole story; and his\\n reasonings and calculations are, for their curiosity, well worth a\\n careful perusal.”—Coleridge, p. 211, sq.\\n\\n [103] The mention of Corinth is an anachronism, as that city was\\n called Ephyre before its capture by the Dorians. But Velleius, vol. i.\\n p. 3, well observes, that the poet would naturally speak of various\\n towns and cities by the names by which they were known in his own\\n time.\\n\\n [104] “Adam, the goodliest man of men since born, His sons, the\\n fairest of her daughters Eve.’—“Paradise Lost,” iv. 323.\\n\\n [105] _Æsetes’ tomb_.

See my notes to my prose translations of the “Odyssey,” ii. p.\\n 21, or on Eur. “Alcest.” vol. i. p. 240.\\n\\n [106] _Zeleia_, another name for Lycia. The inhabitants were greatly\\n devoted to the worship of Apollo. See Muller, “Dorians,” vol. i. p.\\n 248.\\n\\n [107] _Barbarous tongues_. “Various as were the dialects of the\\n Greeks—and these differences existed not only between the several\\n tribes, but even between neighbouring cities—they yet acknowledged in\\n their language that they formed but one nation were but branches of\\n the same family. Homer has ‘men of other tongues:’ and yet Homer had\\n no general name for the Greek nation.”—Heeren, “Ancient Greece,”\\n Section vii. p. 107, sq.\\n\\n [108] _The cranes_.\\n“Marking the tracts of air, the clamorous cranes\\nWheel their due flight in varied ranks descried:\\nAnd each with outstretch’d neck his rank maintains,\\nIn marshall’d order through th’ ethereal void.”\\n\\nLorenzo de Medici, in Roscoe’s Life, Appendix.\\n\\nSee Cary’s Dante: “Hell,” canto v.\\n\\n [109] _Silent, breathing rage._\\n“Thus they,\\nBreathing united force with fixed thought,\\nMoved on in silence.”\\n\\n“Paradise Lost,” book i. 559.\\n\\n [110] “As when some peasant in a bushy brake\\nHas with unwary footing press’d a snake;\\nHe starts aside, astonish’d, when he spies\\nHis rising crest, blue neck, and rolling eyes”\\n\\nDryden’s Virgil, ii. 510.\\n\\n [111] Dysparis, _i.e._ unlucky, ill fated, Paris. This alludes to the\\n evils which resulted from his having been brought up, despite the\\n omens which attended his birth.\\n\\n [112] The following scene, in which Homer has contrived to introduce\\n so brilliant a sketch of the Grecian warriors, has been imitated by\\n Euripides, who in his “Phoenissae” represents Antigone surveying the\\n opposing champions from a high tower, while the paedagogus describes\\n their insignia and details their histories.\\n\\n [113] _No wonder_, &c. Zeuxis, the celebrated artist, is said to have\\n appended these lines to his picture of Helen, as a motto. Valer Max.\\n iii. 7.\\n\\n [114] The early epic was largely occupied with the exploits and\\n sufferings of women, or heroines, the wives and daughters of the\\n Grecian heroes. A nation of courageous, hardy, indefatigable women,\\n dwelling apart from men, permitting only a short temporary\\n intercourse, for the purpose of renovating their numbers, burning out\\n their right breast with a view of enabling themselves to draw the bow\\n freely; this was at once a general type, stimulating to the fancy of\\n the poet, and a theme eminently popular with his hearers. We find\\n these warlike females constantly reappearing in the ancient poems, and\\n universally accepted as past realities in the Iliad. When Priam wishes\\n to illustrate emphatically the most numerous host in which he ever\\n found himself included, he tells us that it was assembled in Phrygia,\\n on the banks of the Sangarius, for the purpose of resisting the\\n formidable Amazons. When Bellerophon is to be employed in a deadly and\\n perilous undertaking, by those who prudently wished to procure his\\n death, he is despatched against the Amazons.—Grote, vol. i p. 289.\\n\\n [115] _Antenor_, like Æneas, had always been favourable to the\\n restoration of Helen. Liv 1. 2.\\n\\n [116]\\n“His lab’ring heart with sudden rapture seized\\nHe paus’d, and on the ground in silence gazed.\\nUnskill’d and uninspired he seems to stand,\\nNor lifts the eye, nor graceful moves the hand:\\nThen, while the chiefs in still attention hung,\\nPours the full tide of eloquence along;\\nWhile from his lips the melting torrent flows,\\nSoft as the fleeces of descending snows.\\nNow stronger notes engage the listening crowd,\\nLouder the accents rise, and yet more loud,\\nLike thunders rolling from a distant cloud.”\\n\\nMerrick’s “Tryphiodorus,” 148, 99.\\n\\n [117] Duport, “Gnomol. Homer,” p. 20, well observes that this\\n comparison may also be sarcastically applied to the _frigid_ style of\\n oratory. It, of course, here merely denotes the ready fluency of\\n Ulysses.\\n\\n [118] _Her brothers’ doom_. They perished in combat with Lynceus and\\n Idas, whilst besieging Sparta. See Hygin. Poet Astr. 32, 22. Virgil\\n and others, however, make them share immortality by turns.\\n\\n [119] Idreus was the arm-bearer and charioteer of king Priam, slain\\n during this war. Cf.

Their medical\\n renown was further prolonged in the subsequent poem of Arktinus, the\\n Iliou Persis, wherein the one was represented as unrivalled in\\n surgical operations, the other as sagacious in detecting and\\n appreciating morbid symptoms. It was Podaleirius who first noticed the\\n glaring eyes and disturbed deportment which preceded the suicide of\\n Ajax.\\n    “Galen appears uncertain whether Asklepius (as well as Dionysus)\\n    was originally a god, or whether he was first a man and then became\\n    afterwards a god; but Apollodorus professed to fix the exact date\\n    of his apotheosis. Throughout all the historical ages the\\n    descendants of Asklepius were numerous and widely diffused. The\\n    many families or gentes, called Asklepiads, who devoted themselves\\n    to the study and practice of medicine, and who principally dwelt\\n    near the temples of Asklepius, whither sick and suffering men came\\n    to obtain relief—all recognized the god not merely as the object of\\n    their common worship, but also as their actual progenitor.”—Grote\\n    vol. i. p. 248.\\n\\n [133]\\n“The plant she bruises with a stone, and stands\\nTempering the juice between her ivory hands\\nThis o’er her breast she sheds with sovereign art\\nAnd bathes with gentle touch the wounded part\\nThe wound such virtue from the juice derives,\\nAt once the blood is stanch’d, the youth revives.”\\n\\n“Orlando Furioso,” book 1.\\n\\n [134] _Well might I wish._\\n\\n“Would heav’n (said he) my strength and youth recall,\\nSuch as I was beneath Praeneste’s wall—\\nThen when I made the foremost foes retire,\\nAnd set whole heaps of conquer’d shields on fire;\\nWhen Herilus in single fight I slew,\\nWhom with three lives Feronia did endue.”\\n\\nDryden’s Virgil, viii. 742.\\n\\n [135] _Sthenelus_, a son of Capaneus, one of the Epigoni.

Coined money is unknown\\n in the Homeric age—the trade carried on being one of barter. In\\n reference also to the metals, it deserves to be remarked, that the\\n Homeric descriptions universally suppose copper, and not iron, to be\\n employed for arms, both offensive and defensive. By what process the\\n copper was tempered and hardened, so as to serve the purpose of the\\n warrior, we do not know; but the use of iron for these objects belongs\\n to a later age.”—Grote, vol. ii. p. 142.\\n\\n [164] _Oh impotent_, &c. “In battle, quarter seems never to have been\\n given, except with a view to the ransom of the prisoner.

Where,\\n for example, one or more heroes are despatched on some commission, to\\n be executed at a certain distance of time or place, the fulfilment of\\n this task is not, as a general rule, immediately described. A certain\\n interval is allowed them for reaching the appointed scene of action,\\n which interval is dramatised, as it were, either by a temporary\\n continuation of the previous narrative, or by fixing attention for a\\n while on some new transaction, at the close of which the further\\n account of the mission is resumed.”\\n\\n [168] _With tablets sealed_. These probably were only devices of a\\n hieroglyphical character. Whether writing was known in the Homeric\\n times is utterly uncertain. See Grote, vol ii. p. 192, sqq.\\n\\n [169] _Solymæan crew_, a people of Lycia.\\n\\n [170] From this “melancholy madness” of Bellerophon, hypochondria\\n received the name of “Morbus Bellerophonteus.” See my notes in my\\n prose translation, p. 112.

This, however, was also one of the ordinary formal modes of\\n punishment for great public offences. It may have been originally\\n connected with the same feeling—the desire of avoiding the pollution\\n of bloodshed—which seems to have suggested the practice of burying\\n prisoners alive, with a scantling of food by their side. Though Homer\\n makes no mention of this horrible usage, the example of the Roman\\n Vestals affords reasons for believing that, in ascribing it to the\\n heroic ages, Sophocles followed an authentic tradition.”—Thirlwall’s\\n Greece, vol. i. p. 171, sq.\\n\\n [175] _Paris’ lofty dome_. “With respect to the private dwellings,\\n which are oftenest described, the poet’s language barely enables us to\\n form a general notion of their ordinary plan, and affords no\\n conception of the style which prevailed in them or of their effect on\\n the eye. It seems indeed probable, from the manner in which he dwells\\n on their metallic ornaments that the higher beauty of proportion was\\n but little required or understood, and it is, perhaps, strength and\\n convenience, rather than elegance, that he means to commend, in\\n speaking of the fair house which Paris had built for himself with the\\n aid of the most skilful masons of Troy.”—Thirlwall’s Greece, vol. i.\\n p. 231.\\n\\n [176] _The wanton courser_.\\n\\n“Come destrier, che da le regie stalle\\n    Ove a l’usa de l’arme si riserba,\\nFugge, e libero al fiu per largo calle\\n    Va tragl’ armenti, o al fiume usato, o a l’herba.”\\n\\nGier, Lib. ix. 75.\\n\\n [177] _Casque_.

No interposition takes place but on the part of the specially\\n authorised agents of Jove, or on that of one or two contumacious\\n deities, described as boldly setting his commands at defiance, but\\n checked and reprimanded for their disobedience; while the other divine\\n warriors, who in the previous and subsequent cantos are so active in\\n support of their favourite heroes, repeatedly allude to the supreme\\n edict as the cause of their present inactivity.”—Mure, vol. i. p 257.\\n See however, Muller, “Greek Literature,” ch. v.

Yet it would seem, from the manner\\nin which the height of heaven is compared with the depth of Tartarus,\\nthat the region of light was thought to have certain bounds. The summit\\nof the Thessalian Olympus was regarded as the highest point on the\\nearth, and it is not always carefully distinguished from the aerian\\nregions above The idea of a seat of the gods—perhaps derived from a\\nmore ancient tradition, in which it was not attached to any\\ngeographical site—seems to be indistinctly blended in the poet’s mind\\nwith that of the real mountain.”—Thirlwall’s Greece, vol. i. p. 217,\\nsq.\\n\\n [191]\\n“Now lately heav’n, earth, another world\\nHung e’er my realm, link’d in a golden chain\\nTo that side heav’n.”\\n\\n—“Paradise Lost,” ii. 1004.\\n\\n [192] _His golden scales_.\\n\\n“Jove now, sole arbiter of peace and war,\\nHeld forth the fatal balance from afar:\\nEach host he weighs; by turns they both prevail,\\nTill Troy descending fix’d the doubtful scale.”\\n\\nMerrick’s Tryphiodorus, v 687, sqq.\\n\\n“Oh’ Eternal, to prevent such horrid fray,\\nHung forth in heav’n his golden scales,\\nWherein all things created first he weighed;\\nThe pendulous round earth, with balanced air\\nIn counterpoise; now ponders all events,\\nBattles and realms.

Such gifts gradually became regular, and formed the\\n income of the German, (Tacit. Germ. Section 15) Persian, (Herodot.\\n iii.89), and other kings. So, too, in the middle ages, ‘The feudal\\n aids are the beginning of taxation, of which they for a long time\\n answered the purpose.’ (Hallam, Middle Ages, ch. x. pt. 1, p. 189)\\n This fact frees Achilles from the apparent charge of sordidness.\\n Plato, however, (De Rep. vi. 4), says, “We cannot commend Phœnix, the\\n tutor of Achilles, as if he spoke correctly, when counselling him to\\n accept of presents and assist the Greeks, but, without presents, not\\n to desist from his wrath, nor again, should we commend Achilles\\n himself, or approve of his being so covetous as to receive presents\\n from Agamemnon,” &c.\\n\\n [202] It may be observed, that, brief as is the mention of Briseïs in\\n the Iliad, and small the part she plays—what little is said is\\n pre-eminently calculated to enhance her fitness to be the bride of\\n Achilles. Purity, and retiring delicacy, are features well contrasted\\n with the rough, but tender disposition of the hero.\\n\\n [203] _Laodice_. Iphianassa, or Iphigenia, is not mentioned by Homer,\\n among the daughters of Agamemnon.\\n\\n [204] “Agamemnon, when he offers to transfer to Achilles seven towns\\n inhabited by wealthy husbandmen, who would enrich their lord by\\n presents and tribute, seems likewise to assume rather a property in\\n them, than an authority over them. And the same thing may be intimated\\n when it is said that Peleus bestowed a great people, the Dolopes of\\n Phthia, on Phœnix.”—Thirlwall’s Greece, vol. i Section 6, p. 162,\\n note.\\n\\n [205] _Pray in deep silence_. Rather: “use well-omened words;” or, as\\n Kennedy has explained it, “Abstain from expressions unsuitable to the\\n solemnity of the occasion, which, by offending the god, might defeat\\n the object of their supplications.”\\n\\n [206] _Purest hands_. This is one of the most ancient superstitions\\n respecting prayer, and one founded as much in nature as in tradition.\\n\\n [207] It must be recollected, that the war at Troy was not a settled\\n siege, and that many of the chieftains busied themselves in piratical\\n expeditions about its neighborhood. Such a one was that of which\\n Achilles now speaks. From the following verses, it is evident that\\n fruits of these maraudings went to the common support of the\\n expedition, and not to the successful plunderer.\\n\\n [208] _Pythia_, the capital of Achilles’ Thessalian domains.\\n\\n [209] _Orchomenian town_. The topography of Orchomenus, in Bœotia,\\n “situated,” as it was, “on the northern bank of the lake Æpais, which\\n receives not only the river Cephisus from the valleys of Phocis, but\\n also other rivers from Parnassus and Helicon” (Grote, vol. p. 181),\\n was a sufficient reason for its prosperity and decay. “As long as the\\n channels of these waters were diligently watched and kept clear, a\\n large portion of the lake was in the condition of alluvial land,\\n pre-eminently rich and fertile. But when the channels came to be\\n either neglected, or designedly choked up by an enemy, the water\\n accumulated in such a degree as to occupy the soil of more than one\\n ancient islet, and to occasion the change of the site of Orchomenus\\n itself from the plain to the declivity of Mount Hyphanteion.” (Ibid.)\\n\\n [210] The phrase “hundred gates,” &c., seems to be merely expressive\\n of a great number. See notes to my prose translation, p. 162.\\n\\n [211] Compare the following pretty lines of Quintus Calaber (Dyce’s\\n Select Translations, p 88).—\\n\\n“Many gifts he gave, and o’er\\nDolopia bade me rule; thee in his arms\\nHe brought an infant, on my bosom laid\\nThe precious charge, and anxiously enjoin’d\\nThat I should rear thee as my own with all\\nA parent’s love.

The epithet abion or abion, in this passage, has\\n occasioned much discussion. It may mean, according as we read it,\\n either “long-lived,” or “bowless,” the latter epithet indicating that\\n they did not depend upon archery for subsistence.\\n\\n [230] Compare Chapman’s quaint, bold verses:—\\n\\n“And as a round piece of a rocke, which with a winter’s flood\\nIs from his top torn, when a shoure poured from a bursten cloud,\\nHath broke the naturall band it had within the roughftey rock,\\nFlies jumping all adourne the woods, resounding everie shocke,\\nAnd on, uncheckt, it headlong leaps till in a plaine it stay,\\nAnd then (tho’ never so impelled), it stirs not any way:—\\nSo Hector,—”\\n\\n [231] This book forms a most agreeable interruption to the continuous\\n round of battles, which occupy the latter part of the Iliad.

But in a genealogy\\n recorded by later writers, he is likewise the adopted son of Asterius,\\n as descendant of Dorus, the son of Helen, and is thus connected with a\\n colony said to have been led into Creta by Tentamus, or Tectamus, son\\n of Dorus, who is related either to have crossed over from Thessaly, or\\n to have embarked at Malea after having led his followers by land into\\n Laconia.”—Thirlwall, p. 136, seq.\\n\\n [237] Milton has emulated this passage, in describing the couch of our\\n first parents:—\\n\\n“Underneath the violet,\\nCrocus, and hyacinth with rich inlay,\\n’Broider’d the ground.”\\n\\n—“Paradise Lost,” iv. 700.\\n\\n [238] _He lies protected_.\\n\\n“Forthwith on all sides to his aid was run\\nBy angels many and strong, who interpos’d\\nDefence, while others bore him on their shields\\nBack to his chariot, where it stood retir’d\\nFrom off the files of war; there they him laid,\\nGnashing for anguish, and despite, and shame.”\\n\\n“Paradise Lost,” vi. 335, seq.\\n\\n [239] _The brazen dome_.

There is a most elegant tribute to his memory in\\n the Preface to the Heroica of Philostratus.\\n\\n [243] _His best beloved_. The following elegant remarks of Thirlwall\\n (Greece, vol. i, p. 176 seq.) well illustrate the character of the\\n friendship subsisting between these two heroes—\\n    “One of the noblest and most amiable sides of the Greek character,\\n    is the readiness with which it lent itself to construct intimate\\n    and durable friendships, and this is a feature no less prominent in\\n    the earliest than in later times. It was indeed connected with the\\n    comparatively low estimation in which female society was held; but\\n    the devotedness and constancy with which these attachments were\\n    maintained, was not the less admirable and engaging. The heroic\\n    companions whom we find celebrated partly by Homer and partly in\\n    traditions which, if not of equal antiquity, were grounded on the\\n    same feeling, seem to have but one heart and soul, with scarcely a\\n    wish or object apart, and only to live as they are always ready to\\n    die for one another. It is true that the relation between them is\\n    not always one of perfect equality; but this is a circumstance\\n    which, while it often adds a peculiar charm to the poetical\\n    description, detracts little from the dignity of the idea which it\\n    presents. Such were the friendships of Hercules and Iolaus, of\\n    Theseus and Pirithous, of Orestes and Pylades; and though These may\\n    owe the greater part of their fame to the later epic or even\\n    dramatic poetry, the moral groundwork undoubtedly subsisted in the\\n    period to which the traditions are referred. The argument of the\\n    Iliad mainly turns on the affection of Achilles for Patroclus,\\n    whose love for the greater hero is only tempered by reverence for\\n    his higher birth and his unequalled prowess. But the mutual regard\\n    which united Idomeneus and Meriones, Diomedes and Sthenelus,\\n    though, as the persons themselves are less important, it is kept\\n    more in the back-ground, is manifestly viewed by the poet in the\\n    same light. The idea of a Greek hero seems not to have been thought\\n    complete, without such a brother in arms by his side.”—Thirlwall,\\n    Greece, vol. i. p. 176, seq.\\n\\n [244]\\n“As hungry wolves with raging appetite,\\nScour through the fields, ne’er fear the stormy night—\\nTheir whelps at home expect the promised food,\\nAnd long to temper their dry chaps in blood—\\nSo rush’d we forth at once.”\\n\\n—Dryden’s Virgil, ii. 479.\\n\\n [245] _The destinies ordain_.—“In the mythology, also, of the Iliad,\\n purely Pagan as it is, we discover one important truth unconsciously\\n involved, which was almost entirely lost from view amidst the nearly\\n equal scepticism and credulity of subsequent ages. Zeus or Jupiter is\\n popularly to be taken as omnipotent. No distinct empire is assigned to\\n fate or fortune; the will of the father of gods and men is absolute\\n and uncontrollable. This seems to be the true character of the Homeric\\n deity, and it is very necessary that the student of Greek literature\\n should bear it constantly in mind. A strong instance in the Iliad\\n itself to illustrate this position, is the passage where Jupiter\\n laments to Juno the approaching death of Sarpedon. ‘Alas me!’ says he\\n ‘since it is fated (moira) that Sarpedon, dearest to me of men, should\\n be slain by Patroclus, the son of Menoetius! Indeed, my heart is\\n divided within me while I ruminate it in my mind, whether having\\n snatched him up from out of the lamentable battle, I should not at\\n once place him alive in the fertile land of his own Lycia, or whether\\n I should now destroy him by the hands of the son of Menoetius!’ To\\n which Juno answers—‘Dost thou mean to rescue from death a mortal man,\\n long since destined by fate (palai pepromenon)? You may do it—but we,\\n the rest of the gods, do not sanction it.’ Here it is clear from both\\n speakers, that although Sarpedon is said to be fated to die, Jupiter\\n might still, if he pleased, save him, and place him entirely out of\\n the reach of any such event, and further, in the alternative, that\\n Jupiter himself would destroy him by the hands of another.”—Coleridge,\\n p. 156. seq.\\n\\n [246] _Thrice at the battlements_. “The art military of the Homeric\\n age is upon a level with the state of navigation just described,\\n personal prowess decided every thing; the night attack and the\\n ambuscade, although much esteemed, were never upon a large scale. The\\n chiefs fight in advance, and enact almost as much as the knights of\\n romance. The siege of Troy was as little like a modern siege as a\\n captain in the guards is like Achilles. There is no mention of a ditch\\n or any other line or work round the town, and the wall itself was\\n accessible without a ladder. It was probably a vast mound of earth\\n with a declivity outwards. Patroclus thrice mounts it in armour.

A few extracts from Mr.\\n Dyce’s version (Select Translations, p. 104, seq.) may here be\\n introduced.\\n\\n“In the wide circle of the shield were seen\\nRefulgent images of various forms,\\nThe work of Vulcan; who had there described\\nThe heaven, the ether, and the earth and sea,\\nThe winds, the clouds, the moon, the sun, apart\\nIn different stations; and you there might view\\nThe stars that gem the still-revolving heaven,\\nAnd, under them, the vast expanse of air,\\nIn which, with outstretch’d wings, the long-beak’d bird\\nWinnow’d the gale, as if instinct with life.\\nAround the shield the waves of ocean flow’d,\\nThe realms of Tethys, which unnumber’d streams,\\nIn azure mazes rolling o’er the earth,\\nSeem’d to augment.”\\n\\n [254] _On seats of stone_. “Several of the old northern Sagas\\n represent the old men assembled for the purpose of judging as sitting\\n on great stones, in a circle called the Urtheilsring or gerichtsring”—\\n Grote, ii. p. 100, note. On the independence of the judicial office in\\n The heroic times, see Thirlwall’s Greece, vol. i. p. 166.\\n\\n [255] _Another part_, &c.\\n\\n“And here\\nWere horrid wars depicted; grimly pale\\nWere heroes lying with their slaughter’d steeds\\nUpon the ground incarnadin’d with blood.\\nStern stalked Bellona, smear’d with reeking gore,\\nThrough charging ranks; beside her Rout was seen,\\nAnd Terror, Discord to the fatal strife\\nInciting men, and Furies breathing flames:\\nNor absent were the Fates, and the tall shape\\nOf ghastly Death, round whom did Battles throng,\\nTheir limbs distilling plenteous blood and sweat;\\nAnd Gorgons, whose long locks were twisting snakes.\\nThat shot their forky tongues incessant forth.\\nSuch were the horrors of dire war.”\\n\\n—Dyce’s Calaber.\\n\\n [256] _A field deep furrowed_.\\n\\n“Here was a corn field; reapers in a row,\\nEach with a sharp-tooth’d sickle in his hand,\\nWork’d busily, and, as the harvest fell,\\nOthers were ready still to bind the sheaves:\\nYoked to a wain that bore the corn away\\nThe steers were moving; sturdy bullocks here\\nThe plough were drawing, and the furrow’d glebe\\nWas black behind them, while with goading wand\\nThe active youths impell’d them. Here a feast\\nWas graved: to the shrill pipe and ringing lyre\\nA band of blooming virgins led the dance.\\nAs if endued with life.”\\n—Dyce’s Calaber.\\n\\n [257] Coleridge (Greek Classic Poets, p. 182, seq.) has diligently\\n compared this with the description of the shield of Hercules by\\n Hesiod. He remarks that, “with two or three exceptions, the imagery\\n differs in little more than the names and arrangements; and the\\n difference of arrangement in the Shield of Hercules is altogether for\\n the worse. The natural consecution of the Homeric images needs no\\n exposition: it constitutes in itself one of the beauties of the work.\\n The Hesiodic images are huddled together without connection or\\n congruity: Mars and Pallas are awkwardly introduced among the Centaurs\\n and Lapithae;— but the gap is wide indeed between them and Apollo with\\n the Muses, waking the echoes of Olympus to celestial harmonies; whence\\n however, we are hurried back to Perseus, the Gorgons, and other images\\n of war, over an arm of the sea, in which the sporting dolphins, the\\n fugitive fishes, and the fisherman on the shore with his casting net,\\n are minutely represented. As to the Hesiodic images themselves, the\\n leading remark is, that they catch at beauty by ornament, and at\\n sublimity by exaggeration; and upon the untenable supposition of the\\n genuineness of this poem, there is this curious peculiarity, that, in\\n the description of scenes of rustic peace, the superiority of Homer is\\n decisive—while in those of war and tumult it may be thought, perhaps,\\n that the Hesiodic poet has more than once the advantage.”\\n\\n [258] “This legend is one of the most pregnant and characteristic in\\n the Grecian Mythology; it explains, according to the religious ideas\\n familiar to the old epic poets, both the distinguishing attributes and\\n the endless toil and endurances of Heracles, the most renowned\\n subjugator of all the semi-divine personages worshipped by the\\n Hellenes,—a being of irresistible force, and especially beloved by\\n Zeus, yet condemned constantly to labour for others and to obey the\\n commands of a worthless and cowardly persecutor. His recompense is\\n reserved to the close of his career, when his afflicting trials are\\n brought to a close: he is then admitted to the godhead, and receives\\n in marriage Hebe.”—Grote, vol. i. p. 128.\\n\\n [259] _Ambrosia_.\\n\\n“The blue-eyed maid,\\nIn ev’ry breast new vigour to infuse.\\nBrings nectar temper’d with ambrosial dews.”\\n\\nMerrick’s Tryphiodorus, vi. 249.\\n\\n [260] “Hell is naked before him, and destruction hath no covering. He\\n stretcheth out the north over the empty place, and hangeth the earth\\n upon nothing. He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the\\n cloud is not rent under them.” Job xxvi. 6-8.\\n\\n [261]\\n“Swift from his throne the infernal monarch ran,\\nAll pale and trembling, lest the race of man,v Slain by Jove’s wrath,\\nand led by Hermes’ rod,\\nShould fill (a countless throng!) his dark abode.”\\n\\nMerrick’s Tryphiodorus, vi. 769, sqq.\\n\\n [262] These words seem to imply the old belief, that the Fates might\\n be delayed, but never wholly set aside.\\n\\n [263] It was anciently believed that it was dangerous, if not fatal,\\n to behold a deity. See Exod. xxxiii. 20; Judg. xiii. 22.\\n\\n [264]\\n“Ere Ilium and the Trojan tow’rs arose,\\nIn humble vales they built their soft abodes.”\\n\\nDryden’s Virgil, iii. 150.\\n\\n [265] _Along the level seas_. Compare Virgil’s description of Camilla,\\n who\\n\\n“Outstripp’d the winds in speed upon the plain,\\nFlew o’er the field, nor hurt the bearded grain:\\nShe swept the seas, and, as she skimm’d along,\\nHer flying feet unbathed on billows hung.”\\n\\nDryden, vii. 1100.\\n\\n [266] _The future father_. “Æneas and Antenor stand distinguished from\\n the other Trojans by a dissatisfaction with Priam, and a sympathy with\\n the Greeks, which is by Sophocles and others construed as treacherous\\n collusion,—a suspicion indirectly glanced at, though emphatically\\n repelled, in the Æneas of Virgil.”—Grote, i. p. 427.\\n\\n [267] Neptune thus recounts his services to Æneas:\\n\\n“When your Æneas fought, but fought with odds\\nOf force unequal, and unequal gods:\\nI spread a cloud before the victor’s sight,\\nSustain’d the vanquish’d, and secured his flight—\\nEven then secured him, when I sought with joy\\nThe vow’d destruction of ungrateful Troy.”\\n\\nDryden’s Virgil, v. 1058.\\n\\n [268] _On Polydore_. Euripides, Virgil, and others, relate that\\n Polydore was sent into Thrace, to the house of Polymestor, for\\n protection, being the youngest of Priam’s sons, and that he was\\n treacherously murdered by his host for the sake of the treasure sent\\n with him.\\n\\n [269] “Perhaps the boldest excursion of Homer into this region of\\n poetical fancy is the collision into which, in the twenty-first of the\\n Iliad, he has brought the river god Scamander, first with Achilles,\\n and afterwards with Vulcan, when summoned by Juno to the hero’s aid.\\n The overwhelming fury of the stream finds the natural interpretation\\n in the character of the mountain torrents of Greece and Asia Minor.\\n Their wide, shingly beds are in summer comparatively dry, so as to be\\n easily forded by the foot passenger. But a thunder-shower in the\\n mountains, unobserved perhaps by the traveller on the plain, may\\n suddenly immerse him in the flood of a mighty river. The rescue of\\n Achilles by the fiery arms of Vulcan scarcely admits of the same ready\\n explanation from physical causes. Yet the subsiding of the flood at\\n the critical moment when the hero’s destruction appeared imminent,\\n might, by a slight extension of the figurative parallel, be ascribed\\n to a god symbolic of the influences opposed to all atmospheric\\n moisture.”—Mure, vol. i. p. 480, sq.\\n\\n [270] Wood has observed, that “the circumstance of a falling tree,\\n which is described as reaching from one of its banks to the other,\\n affords a very just idea of the breadth of the Scamander.”\\n\\n [271] _Ignominious_. Drowning, as compared with a death in the field\\n of battle, was considered utterly disgraceful.\\n\\n [272] _Beneath a caldron_.\\n\\n“So, when with crackling flames a caldron fries,\\nThe bubbling waters from the bottom rise.\\nAbove the brims they force their fiery way;\\nBlack vapours climb aloft, and cloud the day.”\\n\\nDryden’s Virgil, vii. 644.\\n\\n [273] “This tale of the temporary servitude of particular gods, by\\n order of Jove, as a punishment for misbehaviour, recurs not\\n unfrequently among the incidents of the Mythical world.”—Grote, vol.\\n i. p. 156.\\n\\n [274] _Not half so dreadful_.\\n\\n“On the other side,\\nIncensed with indignation, Satan stood\\nUnterrified, and like a comet burn’d,\\nThat fires the length of Ophiuchus huge\\nIn the arctic sky, and from his horrid hair\\nShakes pestilence and war.”\\n\\n—“Paradise Lost,” xi. 708.\\n\\n [275] “And thus his own undaunted mind explores.”—“Paradise Lost,” vi.\\n 113.\\n\\n [276] The example of Nausicaa, in the Odyssey, proves that the duties\\n of the laundry were not thought derogatory, even from the dignity of a\\n princess, in the heroic times.\\n\\n [277] _Hesper shines with keener light_.\\n\\n“Fairest of stars, last in the train of night,\\nIf better thou belong not to the dawn.”\\n\\n“Paradise Lost,” v. 166.\\n\\n [278] Such was his fate. After chasing the Trojans into the town, he\\n was slain by an arrow from the quiver of Paris, directed under the\\n unerring auspices of Apollo. The greatest efforts were made by the\\n Trojans to possess themselves of the body, which was however rescued\\n and borne off to the Grecian camp by the valour of Ajax and Ulysses.\\n Thetis stole away the body, just as the Greeks were about to burn it\\n with funeral honours, and conveyed it away to a renewed life of\\n immortality in the isle of Leuke in the Euxine.\\n\\n [279] _Astyanax_, i.e. the _city-king_ or guardian. It is amusing that\\n Plato, who often finds fault with Homer without reason, should have\\n copied this twaddling etymology into his Cratylus.\\n\\n [280] This book has been closely imitated by Virgil in his fifth book,\\n but it is almost useless to attempt a selection of passages for\\n comparison.\\n\\n [281] _Thrice in order led_. This was a frequent rite at funerals. The\\n Romans had the same custom, which they called _decursio_. Plutarch\\n states that Alexander, in after times, renewed these same honours to\\n the memory of Achilles himself.\\n\\n [282] _And swore_. Literally, and called Orcus, the god of oaths, to\\n witness. See Buttmann, Lexilog, p. 436.\\n\\n [283]\\n“O, long expected by thy friends! from whence\\nArt thou so late return’d for our defence?\\nDo we behold thee, wearied as we are\\nWith length of labours, and with, toils of war?\\nAfter so many funerals of thy own,\\nArt thou restored to thy declining town?\\nBut say, what wounds are these? what new disgrace\\nDeforms the manly features of thy face?”\\n\\nDryden, xi. 369.\\n\\n [284] _Like a thin smoke_. Virgil, Georg. iv. 72.\\n\\n“In vain I reach my feeble hands to join\\nIn sweet embraces—ah! no longer thine!\\nShe said, and from his eyes the fleeting fair\\nRetired, like subtle smoke dissolved in air.”\\n\\nDryden.\\n\\n [285] So Milton:—\\n\\n“So eagerly the fiend\\nO’er bog, o’er steep, through strait, rough, dense, or rare,\\nWith head, hands, wings, or feet pursues his way,\\nAnd swims, or sinks, or wades, or creeps, or flies.”\\n\\n“Paradise Lost,” ii. 948.\\n\\n [286]\\n“An ancient forest, for the work design’d\\n(The shady covert of the savage kind).\\nThe Trojans found: the sounding axe is placed:\\nFirs, pines, and pitch-trees, and the tow’ring pride\\nOf forest ashes, feel the fatal stroke,\\nAnd piercing wedges cleave the stubborn oak.\\nHigh trunks of trees, fell’d from the steepy crown\\nOf the bare mountains, roll with ruin down.”\\n\\nDryden’s Virgil, vi. 261.\\n\\n [287] _He vowed_. This was a very ancient custom.\\n\\n [288] The height of the tomb or pile was a great proof of the dignity\\n of the deceased, and the honour in which he was held.\\n\\n [289] On the prevalence of this cruel custom amongst the northern\\n nations, see Mallet, p. 213.\\n\\n [290] _And calls the spirit_. Such was the custom anciently, even at\\n the Roman funerals.\\n\\n“Hail, O ye holy manes! hail again,\\nPaternal ashes, now revived in vain.”\\n\\nDryden’s Virgil, v. 106.\\n\\n [291] Virgil, by making the boaster vanquished, has drawn a better\\n moral from this episode than Homer. The following lines deserve\\n comparison:—\\n\\n“The haughty Dares in the lists appears:\\nWalking he strides, his head erected bears:\\nHis nervous arms the weighty gauntlet wield,\\nAnd loud applauses echo through the field.\\n* * * *\\nSuch Dares was, and such he strode along,\\nAnd drew the wonder of the gazing throng\\nHis brawny breast and ample chest he shows;\\nHis lifted arms around his head he throws,\\nAnd deals in whistling air his empty blows.\\nHis match is sought, but, through the trembling band,\\nNo one dares answer to the proud demand.\\nPresuming of his force, with sparkling eyes,\\nAlready he devours the promised prize.\\n* * * *\\nIf none my matchless valour dares oppose,\\nHow long shall Dares wait his dastard foes?”\\n\\nDryden’s Virgil, v. 486, seq.\\n\\n [292]\\n“The gauntlet-fight thus ended, from the shore\\nHis faithful friends unhappy Dares bore:\\nHis mouth and nostrils pour’d a purple flood,\\nAnd pounded teeth came rushing with his blood.”\\n\\nDryden’s Virgil, v. 623.\\n\\n [293] “Troilus is only once named in the Iliad; he was mentioned also\\n in the Cypriad but his youth, beauty, and untimely end made him an\\n object of great interest with the subsequent poets.”—Grote, i, p. 399.\\n\\n [294] Milton has rivalled this passage describing the descent of\\n Gabriel, “Paradise Lost,” bk. v. 266, seq.\\n\\n“Down thither prone in flight\\nHe speeds, and through the vast ethereal sky\\nSails between worlds and worlds, with steady wing,\\nNow on the polar winds, then with quick fan\\nWinnows the buxom air. * * * *\\n* * * *\\nAt once on th’ eastern cliff of Paradise\\nHe lights, and to his proper shape returns\\nA seraph wing’d. * * * *\\nLike Maia’s son he stood,\\nAnd shook his plumes, that heavenly fragrance fill’d\\nThe circuit wide.”\\n\\nVirgil, Æn. iv. 350:—\\n\\n“Hermes obeys; with golden pinions binds\\nHis flying feet, and mounts the western winds:\\nAnd whether o’er the seas or earth he flies,\\nWith rapid force they bear him down the skies\\nBut first he grasps within his awful hand\\nThe mark of sovereign power, his magic wand;\\nWith this he draws the ghost from hollow graves;\\nWith this he drives them from the Stygian waves:\\n* * * *\\nThus arm’d, the god begins his airy race,v And drives the racking\\nclouds along the liquid space.”\\n\\nDryden.\\n\\n [295] In reference to the whole scene that follows, the remarks of\\n Coleridge are well worth reading:—\\n    “By a close study of life, and by a true and natural mode of\\n    expressing everything, Homer was enabled to venture upon the most\\n    peculiar and difficult situations, and to extricate himself from\\n    them with the completest success. The whole scene between Achilles\\n    and Priam, when the latter comes to the Greek camp for the purpose\\n    of redeeming the body of Hector, is at once the most profoundly\\n    skilful, and yet the simplest and most affecting passage in the\\n    Iliad. Quinctilian has taken notice of the following speech of\\n    Priam, the rhetorical artifice of which is so transcendent, that if\\n    genius did not often, especially in oratory, unconsciously fulfil\\n    the most subtle precepts of criticism, we might be induced, on this\\n    account alone, to consider the last book of the Iliad as what is\\n    called spurious, in other words, of later date than the rest of the\\n    poem. Observe the exquisite taste of Priam in occupying the mind of\\n    Achilles, from the outset, with the image of his father; in\\n    gradually introducing the parallel of his own situation; and,\\n    lastly, mentioning Hector’s name when he perceives that the hero is\\n    softened, and then only in such a manner as to flatter the pride of\\n    the conqueror. The ego d’eleeinoteros per, and the apusato aecha\\n    geronta, are not exactly like the tone of the earlier parts of the\\n    Iliad. They are almost too fine and pathetic. The whole passage\\n    defies translation, for there is that about the Greek which has no\\n    name, but which is of so fine and ethereal a subtlety that it can\\n    only be felt in the original, and is lost in an attempt to\\n    transfuse it into another language.”—Coleridge, p. 195.\\n\\n [296] “Achilles’ ferocious treatment of the corpse of Hector cannot\\n but offend as referred to the modern standard of humanity. The heroic\\n age, however, must be judged by its own moral laws. Retributive\\n vengeance on the dead, as well as the living, was a duty inculcated by\\n the religion of those barbarous times which not only taught that evil\\n inflicted on the author of evil was a solace to the injured man; but\\n made the welfare of the soul after death dependent on the fate of the\\n body from which it had separated. Hence a denial of the rites\\n essential to the soul’s admission into the more favoured regions of\\n the lower world was a cruel punishment to the wanderer on the dreary\\n shores of the infernal river. The complaint of the ghost of Patroclus\\n to Achilles, of but a brief postponement of his own obsequies, shows\\n how efficacious their refusal to the remains of his destroyer must\\n have been in satiating the thirst of revenge, which, even after death,\\n was supposed to torment the dwellers in Hades. Hence before yielding\\n up the body of Hector to Priam, Achilles asks pardon of Patroclus for\\n even this partial cession of his just rights of retribution.”—Mure,\\n vol. i. 289.\\n\\n [297] Such was the fate of Astyanax, when Troy was taken.\\n\\n“Here, from the tow’r by stern Ulysses thrown,\\nAndromache bewail’d her infant son.”\\n\\nMerrick’s Tryphiodorus, v. 675.\\n\\n [298] The following observations of Coleridge furnish a most gallant\\n and interesting view of Helen’s character—\\n    “Few things are more interesting than to observe how the same hand\\n    that has given us the fury and inconsistency of Achilles, gives us\\n    also the consummate elegance and tenderness of Helen. She is\\n    through the Iliad a genuine lady, graceful in motion and speech,\\n    noble in her associations, full of remorse for a fault for which\\n    higher powers seem responsible, yet grateful and affectionate\\n    towards those with whom that fault had committed her. I have always\\n    thought the following speech in which Helen laments Hector, and\\n    hints at her own invidious and unprotected situation in Troy, as\\n    almost the sweetest passage in the poem. It is another striking\\n    instance of that refinement of feeling and softness of tone which\\n    so generally distinguish the last book of the Iliad from the\\n    rest.”—Classic Poets, p. 198, seq.\\n\\n [299] “And here we part with Achilles at the moment best calculated to\\n exalt and purify our impression of his character. We had accompanied\\n him through the effervescence, undulations, and final subsidence of\\n his stormy passions. We now leave him in repose and under the full\\n influence of the more amiable affections, while our admiration of his\\n great qualities is chastened by the reflection that, within a few\\n short days the mighty being in whom they were united was himself to be\\n suddenly cut off in the full vigour of their exercise.\\n    The frequent and touching allusions, interspersed throughout the\\n    Iliad, to the speedy termination of its hero’s course, and the\\n    moral on the vanity of human life which they indicate, are among\\n    the finest evidences of the spirit of ethic unity by which the\\n    whole framework of the poem is united.”—Mure, vol. i. p 201.\\n\\n [300] Cowper says,—“I cannot take my leave of this noble poem without\\n expressing how much I am struck with the plain conclusion of it. It is\\n like the exit of a great man out of company, whom he has entertained\\n magnificently; neither pompous nor familiar; not contemptuous, yet\\n without much ceremony.” Coleridge, p. 227, considers the termination\\n of “Paradise Lost” somewhat similar.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE ILIAD ***\\n\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\\nbe renamed.\\n\\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\\nfrom people in all walks of life.\\n\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\\'s\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\\nwww.gutenberg.org\\n\\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation\\n\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\\'s EIN or federal tax identification\\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\\nU.S. federal laws and your state\\'s laws.\\n\\nThe Foundation\\'s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\\'s website\\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\\n\\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\nstatus with the IRS.\\n\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\n\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\\n\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\\n\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\\nvolunteer support.\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\nedition.\\n\\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\\n\\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\n\\n'"
